Foreword
The primary purpose of the three volumes of the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue 
Manual (IAMSAR Manual) is to assist States in meeting their own search and rescue (SAR) needs, and the 
obligations they accepted under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the International Convention

on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979 and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 
(SOLAS). These volumes provide guidelines for a common aviation and maritime approach to organizing and 
providing SAR services. States are encouraged to develop and improve their SAR services, cooperate with 
neighbouring States and to consider their SAR services to be part of a global SAR system.

Each volume of the IAMSAR Manual is written with specific SAR system duties in mind, and can be used as 
a stand-alone document, or, in conjunction with the other two volumes, as a means to attain a full view of 
the SAR system. Depending on the duties assigned, it may be necessary to hold only one or two, or all three 
volumes.
The Organization and Management volume (volume I) discusses the global SAR system concept, establishment

and improvement of national and regional SAR systems, and cooperation with neighbouring States to provide 
effective and economical SAR services;
The Mission Coordination volume (volume II) assists personnel who plan and coordinate SAR operations and 
exercises; and
The Mobile Facilities volume (volume III) is intended to be carried aboard rescue units, aircraft and vessels to 
help with performance of a search, rescue, or on-scene coordinator function and with aspects of SAR that

pertain to their own emergencies.
Organization and Management
Chapter 1 presents an overview of the SAR system concept, including what is involved in providing SAR 
services, and why such services are required and beneficial. The SAR system is examined from a global, 
regional and national perspective.
Chapter 2 introduces some of the key components of the SAR system. These include communications, rescue

coordination centres and sub-centres, operational and support facilities and the on-scene coordinator.
Chapter 3 considers the use of training, qualification, and certification processes to develop professionally 
competent SAR personnel. A number of aspects of training and exercises used for training are examined in 
detail.

Chapter 1
General system concept
1.1 Establishing services
1.1.1 Every State recognizes the great importance of saving lives and the need to be directly involved in 
rendering aeronautical and maritime search and rescue (SAR) services to persons in distress. This 
Manual provides a manager’s perspective on supporting SAR services under the framework of SAR

initiatives sponsored by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International 
Maritime Organization (IMO), two agencies of the United Nations devoted to aeronautical and 
maritime transportation safety, respectively.
1.1.2 With a focus on the humanitarian nature of their work, member States of ICAO and IMO cooperate 
to develop and sponsor vital standards and recommendations, to provide other types of assistance to

States to help prevent and cope with distress situations and to facilitate international cooperation and 
coordination on a daily basis.
1.1.3 ICAO and IMO jointly developed this Manual to foster cooperation between themselves, between 
neighbouring States, and between aeronautical and maritime authorities. The goal of the Manual is to 
assist State authorities to economically establish effective SAR services, to promote harmonization of

aeronautical and maritime SAR services, and to ensure that persons in distress will be assisted without 
regard to their locations, nationality, or circumstances. State authorities are encouraged to promote, 
where possible, harmonization of aeronautical and maritime SAR services.
1.1.4 This Manual will assist those responsible for establishing, managing, and supporting SAR services to 
understand the:
 – functions and importance of SAR services;

– functions and importance of SAR services;
 – relationships between global, regional, and national aspects of SAR;
 – components and support infrastructure essential for SAR;
 – training needed to coordinate, conduct, and support SAR operations;
 – communications functions and requirements for SAR; and
 – basic principles of managing and improving SAR services to ensure success.
1.1.5 This volume is one of three developed by ICAO and IMO as the International Aeronautical and

Maritime Search and Rescue Manual. The others are volume II for Mission Coordination and volume III 
for Mobile Facilities. This volume attempts to ensure that managers understand the basic concepts 
and principles involved in SAR, and to provide practical information and guidance to help managers 
establish and support SAR services.
1.2 Benefits of services
1.2.1 Besides reduction of loss of life and suffering by providing rescue services, a State’s concern and

Chapter 1 – General system concept
1-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
environments, tourism and economic development. This is especially true when the SAR system 
is associated with programmes aimed at preventing or reducing the effects of mishaps, sometimes 
referred to as “Preventive SAR.”
(b) Availability of SAR resources often provides the initial response and relief capabilities critical 
to saving lives in early stages of natural and man-made disasters. Therefore, SAR services are

sometimes made an integral part of any local, national or regional emergency management 
system.
(c) Well-performed SAR operations can provide positive publicity about situations which may 
otherwise be viewed negatively. However, the opposite is also true; a poor response or ineffective 
response to a major accident or disaster can also result in worldwide publicity and adversely 
affect sensitive industries such as tourism and transportation.

(d) SAR provides an excellent means for promoting cooperation and communication among States 
and between organizations at local, national, and international levels, because it is a relatively 
non-controversial and humanitarian mission. Cooperation in this area can lead to cooperation in 
other areas as well and can be used as a leadership tool for promoting good working relationships.
(e) The value of property which can be saved in association with SAR activities can be high and

provide additional justification for SAR services.
1.3 Legal basis for services
1.3.1 As Party to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the International 
Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, or the Convention on International Civil Aviation, a 
Party undertakes to provide certain aeronautical and/or maritime SAR coordination and services. 
Reference to Search and Rescue is also contained in the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, 1982. This

Convention includes a general statement at Article 98, paragraph 2, dealing with search and rescue:
 “Every coastal State shall promote the establishment, operation and maintenance of an adequate 
and effective search and rescue service regarding safety on and over the water and, where 
circumstances so require, by way of mutual regional arrangements, cooperate with neighbouring 
States for this purpose.”

States for this purpose.”
 The international community expects these commitments to be fulfilled by all State parties.
1.3.2 These services can be provided by States individually establishing effective national SAR organizations, 
or by establishing a SAR organization jointly with one or more other States. The role of agreements 
and plans in establishing SAR services will be discussed throughout this Manual.

1.3.3 Appendix M provides an overview of the relevant articles, annexes and chapters of the Convention 
on International Civil Aviation, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), and 
the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue.
1.3.4 Every State should have in place statutes and related provisions that establish a legal foundation for 
establishing a SAR organization and its resources, policies, and procedures.

1.3.5 SAR managers should seek legal advice on how domestic and international laws pertain to SAR 
policies and procedures.
1.3.6 State legislative provisions should be aligned with accepted principles of international law, and may 
serve purposes such as:
 – recognizing the SAR function as a State responsibility;
 – implementing IMO and ICAO requirements and standards;
 – designating SAR agencies and their general responsibilities; and

– defining the jurisdiction and legal authority of the RCC in accordance with relevant standards 
of ICAO and IMO.
1.3.7 Legislation may also be used to promote sound design, construction, maintenance and operation of 
aircraft, vessels and other craft.
1.3.8 International law addresses concerns for saving lives and concerns for sovereignty. Neighbouring 
States should seek practical means to balance these concerns for situations where entry of foreign SAR

facilities into territorial waters or territory may be necessary or appropriate.
1.3.9 Sample legislation is provided in appendix A.
1.4 Basic system functions
1.4.1 Any SAR system should be structured to provide all SAR services:
 – receive, acknowledge, and relay notifications of distress from alerting posts;
 – coordinate search response;
 – coordinate rescue response and delivery of survivors to a place of safety; and

– provide medical advice, initial medical assistance or medical evacuation.
1.4.2 Chapter 2 discusses the primary SAR system components available or necessary to carry out the above 
functions and chapter 4 elaborates on the communications component. Portions of chapters 2 and 5 
review the staffing required to perform basic SAR system functions and their needs, and chapter 3 
discusses how SAR personnel can achieve an effective level of professionalism in their work.

1.5 System management and support
1.5.1 The SAR system cannot be organized and effective without management and support. Chapters 5 
and 6 attempt to ensure that SAR system managers understand:
 – the fundamentals of the system they are managing;
 – their own basic responsibilities and functions;
 – key types of SAR plans and planning processes; and
 – how to begin with available resources and economically improve the system.

1.5.2 To ensure success, the involved parties must be committed to providing the best possible SAR services 
with available resources. This commitment should also be reflected in national legislation designating 
agencies responsible for SAR.
1.5.3 Agencies or persons may be designated as SAR coordinators (SCs), and given oversight responsibilities 
within the national SAR organization. Besides SCs, others will be involved in managing and supporting

various aspects of the SAR organization and system. “SC” is simply an optional designation which 
may be used to highlight the fact that coordination is important at the management level, in addition 
to the coordination centre and on-scene levels, of the SAR system.
1.5.4 States can assign SAR responsibilities as they choose. For illustration, some States assign SCs from 
departments or ministries responsible for maritime or aeronautical safety or for implementation of the

Conventions of IMO or ICAO. Alternatives may include assigning the Minister of Transport who often 
has overall responsibility for both aeronautical and maritime safety or assigning SCs for each of these 
areas. When States cooperate to form a regional SAR system, each State may wish to assign an SC to 
oversee its portion of the system. States with several organizations involved in providing SAR services 
may have several entities doing what could be referred to as SC functions.

Chapter 1 – General system concept
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 1-3
 – defining the jurisdiction and legal authority of the RCC in accordance with relevant standards 
of ICAO and IMO.
1.3.7 Legislation may also be used to promote sound design, construction, maintenance and operation of 
aircraft, vessels and other craft.
1.3.8 International law addresses concerns for saving lives and concerns for sovereignty. Neighbouring

States should seek practical means to balance these concerns for situations where entry of foreign SAR 
facilities into territorial waters or territory may be necessary or appropriate.
1.3.9 Sample legislation is provided in appendix A.
1.4 Basic system functions
1.4.1 Any SAR system should be structured to provide all SAR services:
 – receive, acknowledge, and relay notifications of distress from alerting posts;
 – coordinate search response;

– coordinate search response;
 – coordinate rescue response and delivery of survivors to a place of safety; and
 – provide medical advice, initial medical assistance or medical evacuation.
1.4.2 Chapter 2 discusses the primary SAR system components available or necessary to carry out the above 
functions and chapter 4 elaborates on the communications component. Portions of chapters 2 and 5 
review the staffing required to perform basic SAR system functions and their needs, and chapter 3

discusses how SAR personnel can achieve an effective level of professionalism in their work.
1.5 System management and support
1.5.1 The SAR system cannot be organized and effective without management and support. Chapters 5 
and 6 attempt to ensure that SAR system managers understand:
 – the fundamentals of the system they are managing;
 – their own basic responsibilities and functions;
 – key types of SAR plans and planning processes; and

– how to begin with available resources and economically improve the system.
1.5.2 To ensure success, the involved parties must be committed to providing the best possible SAR services 
with available resources. This commitment should also be reflected in national legislation designating 
agencies responsible for SAR.
1.5.3 Agencies or persons may be designated as SAR coordinators (SCs), and given oversight responsibilities

within the national SAR organization. Besides SCs, others will be involved in managing and supporting 
various aspects of the SAR organization and system. “SC” is simply an optional designation which 
may be used to highlight the fact that coordination is important at the management level, in addition 
to the coordination centre and on-scene levels, of the SAR system.
1.5.4 States can assign SAR responsibilities as they choose. For illustration, some States assign SCs from

departments or ministries responsible for maritime or aeronautical safety or for implementation of the 
Conventions of IMO or ICAO. Alternatives may include assigning the Minister of Transport who often 
has overall responsibility for both aeronautical and maritime safety or assigning SCs for each of these 
areas. When States cooperate to form a regional SAR system, each State may wish to assign an SC to

Chapter 1 – General system concept
1-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
1.5.5 SCs seldom control all of the resources available for SAR operations. Therefore, they may arrange 
agreements with military and other agencies or organizations for use of resources.
1.5.6 Close cooperation between various civilian and military organizations is essential. One way to 
handle this is through national SAR coordinating committees which is further discussed in chapter 6.

Legislation could provide for use of military and other public resources to support SAR.
1.5.7 Resources will be needed to gather performance data and review, analyse and recommend 
improvements in the SAR system and its operation. However, even before a new system is started, a 
needs and capabilities analysis should be conducted. Chapters 5 and 6 will help with these efforts.
1.5.8 SAR cases, accidents, exercises and drills should be carefully assessed and potential improvements

to the SAR system identified. Lessons identified in such cases, and other information of use to the 
SAR community, should be shared as appropriate at local, national, regional and/or international 
level. States should consider whether to make formal reports to IMO and/or ICAO. The International 
Maritime Rescue Federation also provides an information-sharing platform: see appendix D 
“Information sources”.

“Information sources”.
1.5.9 It is important to note the distinction between a “lesson identified” and a “lesson learned”. Lessons 
from SAR events may be identified by SAR authorities, responders, investigation authorities and others 
involved. These lessons should be analysed and decisions made about what actions may be required 
as a result. Once actions are agreed, effort, resources and time are required to implement them. Only

when the actions have been fully implemented can the lessons be said to have been learned.
1.5.10 Commitments of various agencies and States to support the SAR system are often documented in 
a variety of plans, agreements, memoranda of understanding, etc., which evolve over time in a 
hierarchical fashion at the local, national and regional levels. Such instruments are discussed in detail 
in various other places in this Manual. Great care should be exercised in drafting such documents,

so that they support SAR rather than unrelated concerns and remain consistent with higher level 
instruments and with international law.
1.5.11 Almost every State can satisfy its SAR needs cost-effectively by using all available resources, not just 
dedicated or specially designated resources; typical sources are discussed in chapter 2. Government, 
industry and general population sources tend to desire to support the SAR organization, but SAR

managers need to take the initiative to make arrangements for them to do so. With a few exceptions, 
SAR resources are multi-mission facilities, that is, they perform SAR functions in addition to other 
missions.
1.5.12 Advanced planning, training, and some specialized equipment can often economically improve the 
quality of SAR services performed by alternative existing resources. This may reduce or eliminate the 
need for specially designated SAR units (SRUs) for some States.

1.5.13 When necessary, a rescue coordination centre (RCC) with an associated search and rescue region (SRR), 
and perhaps a rescue sub-centre (RSC) with one or more associated search and rescue sub-regions 
(SRSs), should be established. All RCCs and RSCs must satisfy certain minimum requirements. Provision 
of these and other facilities for SAR is discussed further in chapter 2.
1.5.14 The general levels and functions of the SAR system are shown in table 1-1.

1.6 The global concept
1.6.1 Understanding national SAR efforts as an integral part of a worldwide SAR system affects the overall 
approach a State will take to establish, provide and improve SAR services. Briefly, the goal of ICAO

and IMO is to provide an effective worldwide system, so that wherever people sail or fly, SAR services 
will be available if needed.
1.6.2 In most areas of the world, the fastest, most effective and practical way to achieve this goal is to 
develop regional systems associated with each ocean area and continent . This differs from the 
approach whereby every State independently establishes a complete stand-alone SAR system with

geographic areas of responsibility acceptable to their neighbouring States, the collection of which will 
comprise the global system. However, the regional approach does require the States associated with 
an ocean or land area to collaborate and cooperate to develop and operate the regional system.
1.6.3 A basic, practical, and humanitarian characteristic of the global aspect of SAR is that it eliminates

the need for each State to provide SAR services for its own citizens wherever they travel worldwide. 
Instead, the globe is divided into SRRs, each with associated SAR services which assist anyone in 
distress within the SRR without regard to nationality or circumstances.
1.7 National and regional systems
1.7.1 SAR systems can be established on a national or regional level, or both. Either way, the process

involves establishment of one or more SRRs, along with capabilities to receive alerts, and to coordinate 
and conduct SAR services within each SRR via an RCC. Each SRR needs an RCC, but each State does 
not necessarily need an SRR if one RCC can be supported by and serve more than one State. This is 
especially true in ocean areas. In such cases, each State may establish an RSC. Chapter 2 will further 
discuss the establishment of SRRs.

discuss the establishment of SRRs.
1.7. 2 A regional approach can reduce cost and improve distribution of distress alerts, coverage and services. 
For example, it is usually less operationally complex, and more economical and effective, for States 
within a region to share the use and support of long-range terrestrial and satellite communications 
facilities and communications registration databases to support SAR. States can sometimes support

each other with SRUs to reduce the total number of units needed for adequate coverage and readiness. 
Training and other types of resources can be shared to everyone’s benefit. Nevertheless, participation 
in a regional system may not be the best approach for every State.
1.7. 3 Establishment of national or regional SAR systems is typically based on development of multilateral 
national or regional plans, agreements, etc. (further discussed in other portions of this volume), to suit

the desires and needs of the States involved. These documents may discuss establishment of RSCs, 
equivalent arrangements in lieu of establishing SRRs, etc., but usually provide for:
 – effective use of all available resources for SAR;
 – delineation of SRRs;
 – description of relationships between the parties;
 – discussion of how higher level conventions, plans, agreements, etc., will be implemented and 
supported.
1.7.4 The basic requirements for developing an effective SAR system include:

– legislative establishment of the SAR service(s);
 – arrangements for use of all available resources, and provision of others if necessary;
 – establishing geographic areas of responsibility with associated RCCs and RSCs;
 – staffing, training, and other personnel support to manage and operate the system;
 – adequate and functioning communications capabilities; and
 – agreements, plans and related documents, to achieve goals and define working relationships.

1.8 Search and rescue (SAR) operations by maritime rescue services  
in time of armed conflict
  Note: The guidance contained in section 1.8 has been prepared by the International Committee of the 
Red Cross.
1.8.1 The four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 1977 are the bedrock of 
international humanitarian law (IHL). IHL is a body of law underpinned by the principle of respect for

the life and dignity of the individual in situations of armed conflict. The second of the four Geneva 
Conventions (GC II) concerns armed conflicts that take place wholly or in part at sea and extends this 
principle to the wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of the armed forces at sea. Recognizing 
the important role search and rescue operations play in implementing its provisions, GC II extends

protection to small coastal rescue craft and fixed coastal rescue installations used by such craft, such 
as rescue coordination centres, repair boats, sickbays and hangars for their humanitarian mission, 
including for SAR operations concerning civilians.
1.8.2 Such craft and their associated fixed coastal rescue installations, when employed by a State that is 
party to a conflict (whether by its armed forces or by civilian governmental agencies) or by officially

recognized lifeboat institutions (i.e. the institution must have been approved or authorized by a 
governmental authority or other public body to perform coastal rescue functions, which presupposes 
the existence of a legal or administrative framework in the State in which the lifeboat institution 
operates to provide for its prior approval or authorization in peacetime) “ shall be respected and 
protected, that is, may not be attacked, captured or otherwise prevented from performing their

humanitarian tasks, so far as operational requirements permit”.
1.8.3 In contrast to the protection owed to large hospital ships, the concession that coastal rescue craft 
must be respected and protected “so far as operational requirements permit”, allows for operational 
considerations by a reasonable commander to justify interference with a rescue craft by, for example, 
preventing them from performing their humanitarian tasks in a given sea area. However, the rules on

the conduct of hostilities, as set out in Additional Protocol I of 1977 (API), apply in parallel and an 
attacker would not be absolved from the fundamental obligations to target only military objectives, to 
take all feasible precautions and to refrain from attacks that would be indiscriminate.
1.8.4 Neutral coastal rescue craft (i.e. craft of a State which is not a Party to an armed conflict between two

or more other States) enjoy protection under other sources of international law and may also obtain 
special protection under GC II. Neutral vessels that agree to take on board and care for the wounded, 
sick and shipwrecked and to collect the dead “shall enjoy special protection and facilities to carry 
out such assistance”.
1.8.5 The marking of coastal rescue craft in times of armed conflict is not constitutive of their protection but

merely facilitates their identification by parties to the conflict. GC II provides that all exterior surfaces 
of the craft shall be white and that one or more dark red crosses or other emblems recognized by 
international humanitarian law, in particular the red crescent and the red crystal, shall be displayed on 
each side of the hull and on the horizontal surfaces. Although the Convention is silent on the marking

of fixed coastal installations, it is reasonable that they may, in wartime, display the distinctive emblem 
of the red cross, the red crescent or the red crystal on a white background.
1.8.6 These traditional marking methods might not suffice to ensure the proper identification of protected 
vessels in view of modern techniques of naval warfare, such as long-fire and submarine capabilities. 
Under GC II, the parties to the conflict are encouraged to conclude special agreements on the “most

modern methods available to facilitate the identification of hospital ships”. There is no reason why 
agreements could not also be concluded for coastal rescue craft. Such agreements could be critical to 
ensure that protected craft are effectively identified by parties to the conflict, and given the protection 
to which they are entitled in order to carry out their humanitarian work.
1.8.7 GC II moreover requires that the parties to the conflict be notified of the names and characteristics of

Chapter 1 – General system concept
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 1-7
private lifeboat institutions must have received an official commission and provided with certificates 
from the responsible authorities stating that they have been under proper control. Furthermore, to 
benefit from the protection of GC II the rescue craft must not be used for any military purpose and 
must not hamper the movements of combatants. They must also afford relief and assistance to the

System components
2.1  SAR as a system
2.1.1 The SAR system, like any other system, has individual components that must work together to provide 
the overall service. Development of a SAR system typically involves establishment of one or more 
SRRs, along with capabilities to receive alerts and to coordinate and provide SAR services within each 
SRR. Each SRR is associated with an RCC. For aeronautical purposes, SRRs often coincide with flight

information regions (FIRs). The goal of ICAO and IMO conventions relating to SAR is to establish a 
global SAR system. Operationally, the global SAR system relies upon States to establish their national 
SAR systems and then integrate provision of their services with other States for worldwide coverage.
2.1.2 Every SRR has unique transportation, climate, topography and physical characteristics. These factors

create a different set of problems for SAR operations in each SRR. Such factors influence the choice 
and composition of the services, facilities, equipment and staffing required by each SAR service. The 
primary system components are:
 – communications throughout the SRR and with external SAR services;
 – an RCC for the coordination of SAR services;
 – if necessary, one or more RSCs to support an RCC within its SRR;

– SAR facilities, including SRUs with specialized equipment and trained personnel, as well as other 
resources which can be used to conduct SAR operations;
 – medical advice and medical assistance and evacuation services;
 – on-scene coordinator (OSC) assigned, as necessary, for coordinating the on-scene activities of 
all participating facilities; and
 – support facilities that provide services in support of SAR operations.

2.1.3 Establishment of the global aeronautical and maritime SAR systems under their respective international 
conventions provides the framework for a national system to handle SAR matters on land within the 
State and its SRR. Local government authorities and police would typically have the responsibility for 
land SAR and may not involve an RCC. However, the national SAR system should have arrangements

in place for coordination with local authorities for land SAR response, as appropriate. In some cases, 
the national SAR system may be designated as being responsible for conducting certain land SAR 
operations; or, it may have a supporting role because the RCC received the initial alert or the local 
authorities requested the support of nearby national SAR facilities.
2.2 Communications
2.2.1 Good communications are essential. They should promptly provide the RCC with alerting information

permitting the RCC to dispatch SRUs and other resources to search areas without delay and to maintain 
two-way contact with the persons in distress. Chapter 4 summarizes the general communications 
capability and equipment the RCC should have. The SAR organization is alerted to an actual or 
potential distress situation directly or by means of alerting posts. Alerting posts are facilities that

Chapter 2 – System components
2-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
sources should be forwarded immediately to the RCC or RSC, which decides on the type of response. 
The RCC or RSC may have the communications capability itself or may rely upon other facilities to 
forward alerts and to carry out SAR response communications. Figure 2-1 outlines the general SAR 
communications system.
2.2.2 The main functions of a SAR communications system are:

– receipt of alerts from equipment used by persons in distress;
 – exchange of information with persons in distress, and among the SAR mission coordinator (SMC), 
OSC and SAR facilities for coordination of responses to SAR incidents; and
 – direction finding (DF) and homing which allow SRUs to be dispatched to the vicinity of the 
distress and to home on signals from equipment used by survivors.

 Alerting posts
2.2.3 Alerting posts include any facility involved in receiving information about an apparent distress situation 
and relaying it to an RCC or RSC. They include facilities such as air traffic services (ATS) units or coast 
radio stations (CRSs). Communications may or may not be the primary purpose for the alerting post, 
but the post must be able to forward the distress information to the RCC. Chapter 4 discusses alerting

posts in more detail.
2.2.4 The ability of an RCC to act quickly and effectively when an emergency occurs depends largely on the 
information forwarded to it by alerting posts. If alerting posts are used, the RCC or RSC should ensure 
that the alerting post is well qualified to carry out its responsibilities. It is essential that communications 
between an alerting post and the RCC, RSC or local SRU are by fast and reliable means. Such channels

should be checked regularly and could be established by voice or data communications via direct 
or public telephone, radiotelephone, radiotelegraph or other means. Ideally, data alerts should be 
automatically routed to the responsible RCC or RSC over communication links which help preserve 
the distress priority.
 Locating
2.2.5 Locating capabilities enable the responding SAR facilities to minimize the search time and to get to

the actual position of distress for rescue. There are basic international requirements for the types of 
equipment that must be carried by ships and aircraft.
(a) Most civil aircraft operating over ocean areas and remote land areas, and many other aircraft, 
are required to carry an emergency locator transmitter (ELT). Designated SAR aircraft must be 
able to home onto ELT 121.5 MHz signals from ELTs used for locating a distress scene and 
survivors.

survivors.
(b) Ships and some other craft are required to carry emergency position-indicating radio beacons 
(EPIRBs) capable of transmitting signals. The purpose of the EPIRB signals is to indicate that a 
distress exists and to facilitate the location of survivors in SAR operations. Merchant vessels and 
survival craft have additional requirements which are discussed in chapter 4.
2.2.6 Having a very precise search object position is useful but does not eliminate the need for SRU

homing capabilities. This is especially true if the SRU does not have precise navigation equipment or 
if operations take place at night or in other low-visibility conditions.
2.2.7 Due to the importance of position information for SAR operations, various suitable means should be 
provided within an SRR to determine positions. These may include DF stations, surveillance systems 
for aircraft and vessel traffic service systems. If there is any way to confirm the position reported in an

alert, it would be prudent to do so, especially with initial EPIRB and ELT alerts via Cospas-Sarsat which 
provide both a true and an image position.
 SAR coordination
2.2.8 Communications among SAR facilities will depend on local agreements and the organization of the 
SAR services in the SRR and on the equipment available. Communications with mobile facilities may 
be handled directly by the RCC or RSC or via capable associated alerting posts. Communications with

alerting posts or other elements of the SAR system, including international communications among 
RCCs, should be reliable and, ideally, either be dedicated or preserve message priority or pre-emptive 
handling. RCCs normally assign a SAR mission coordinator (SMC) to handle a SAR incident. The 
SMC may specify pre-planned communications channels for coordination with the OSC and for 
communications among facilities on scene.

communications among facilities on scene.
2.2.9 Communications to and from RCCs and RSCs should be as timely and reliable as possible and sufficient 
to handle the total diversity and volume of needs for the worst potential scenarios. Specific details are 
provided in the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination.
2.2.10 SAR personnel should have national authority for their RCCs and RSCs to directly respond to

requests for assistance from craft in distress, or from other RCCs or RSCs. Except in rare cases, related 
communications for such requests should be routed directly to the RCC or RSC rather than via 
diplomatic channels.
 On-scene
2.2.11 On-scene channels are used between SRUs and the OSC. The SMC should specify an on-scene 
communications channel for use by all SRUs based on the equipment carried by the SRUs. If an

on-scene radio frequency is required for communications between air and surface facilities involved 
in a SAR operation, distress and on-scene frequencies may be used. Designated SAR aircraft operating 
in maritime areas should be equipped with a frequency for communicating with vessels during 
SAR operations.
2.2.12 Administrations should encourage voluntary fitting of air band radio equipment, especially on marine

SAR units and government vessels, but also on SOLAS ships operating in areas where working with 
aircraft not fitted with maritime band radio equipment is known to be a possibility.
2.2.13 SAR coordinators should consider the possible need for communications between aircraft and surface 
units within their SAR Regions, and ensure that this need can be met even for aircraft that cannot 
communicate directly on maritime frequencies. Typically, the RCC should be able to provide a

communication link between the aircraft and surface units with their own equipment or by making 
other arrangements. SAR and government vessels should be encouraged to fit equipment to be able to 
communicate directly on aeronautical frequencies. Passenger ships subject to the SOLAS Convention 
are required to have this capability.
2.3 Rescue coordination centres
2.3.1 The RCC is an operational facility responsible for promoting efficient organization of SAR services

and for coordinating the conduct of SAR operations within an SRR. An RCC coordinates, but does not 
necessarily provide, SAR facilities throughout the internationally recognized SRR described in either 
the Regional Air Navigation Plans (RANPs) of ICAO or the Global SAR Plan of IMO. Aeronautical 
SAR responsibility may be met by means of an aeronautical RCC (ARCC). Coastal States with the 
added responsibility for maritime SAR incidents can meet this with a maritime RCC (MRCC). When

2.3 Rescue coordination centres
2.3.1 The RCC is an operational facility responsible for promoting efficient organization of SAR services 
and for coordinating the conduct of SAR operations within an SRR. An RCC coordinates, but does not 
necessarily provide, SAR facilities throughout the internationally recognized SRR described in either 
the Regional Air Navigation Plans (RANPs) of ICAO or the Global SAR Plan of IMO. Aeronautical

Chapter 2 – System components
2-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
practicable, States should consider co-locating or combining their maritime and aeronautical RCCs  
into a joint RCC (JRCC).
 Note: The term RCC will be used within this Manual to apply to either aeronautical or maritime 
centres; ARCC or MRCC will be used as the context warrants.
 Note: A JRCC may be established either by physical co-location or by the integration of communications,

information and computer technology between an ARCC and an MRCC to achieve full search and 
rescue coordination functionality.
2.3.2 SAR managers should ensure that the RCC is familiar with the capabilities of all of the facilities 
available for SAR in its SRR. Collectively, these facilities are the means by which the RCC conducts 
its operations. Some of these facilities will be immediately suitable for use; others may have to be

enhanced by changing organizational relationships or supplying extra equipment and training. If the 
facilities available in certain parts of an SRR cannot provide adequate assistance, arrangements should 
be made to provide additional facilities.
2.3.3 Cooperative arrangements among States could make it unnecessary for some States to have an RCC. 
RSCs (discussed later in this chapter) may be established under an RCC of the State concerned, under

an RCC operated by another State or under an RCC operated by more than one State.
2.3.4  JRCCs can be established at minimal cost by combining aeronautical and maritime RCCs. Staffing 
would be determined by the responsible agencies and could include joint staffing by more than one 
agency. This cooperation could help in developing better capabilities and plans to assist both aircraft 
and ships in distress. Benefits include:
 – fewer facilities to establish or maintain;
 – reduced cost;

– reduced cost;
 – less complexity for alerting posts in forwarding distress alerts; and
 – better coordination and sharing of SAR expertise.
  A coastal State may have an MRCC but not be able to be provided with an ARCC. In such a case, 
the SAR manager should arrange a suitable organizational relationship to provide the MRCC with 
aeronautical advice. Advice may be available from aeronautical facilities close to hand, such as an

aerodrome tower, an ARCC, a flight information centre (FIC), or an area control centre (ACC).
2.3.5 Properly established, the JRCC may improve SAR service performance in most areas. The RCC chief 
operates the JRCC so that neither the aeronautical nor maritime community receives special attention 
at the expense of the other.
 Purpose and requirements
2.3.6 ICAO’s Annex 12 and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue require that SAR

providers establish an RCC for each SRR. The following sections detail some minimum requirements 
for these centres. More information on specific RCC and RSC requirements is provided in the IAMSAR 
Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination.
2.3.7 The RCC must have certain basic capabilities before it is recognized as having responsibility for an 
SRR by listing in the ICAO RANP or the IMO Global SAR Plan. Additional or improved capabilities

may be added as ability and resources permit. A fully capable RCC may be viewed as having two sets 
of capabilities, ”required” and “desired.” Table 2-1 outlines these capabilities.
 Facilities and equipment
2.3.8 An RCC should be located where it can effectively perform its functions within its SRR. The RCC may 
use accommodations at an existing suitable facility. Often agencies responsible for communications,

Chapter 2 – System components
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 2-5
mission. This arrangement makes use of existing equipment and trained, experienced staff. However, 
additional personnel or space may be needed depending on the expected number and complexity 
of SAR operations. Also, the RCC may be located close to a well-equipped centre such as a flight 
information centre (FIC) or area control centre (ACC) so that additional communications facilities can

be kept to a minimum. In addition to communications facilities and general office equipment, a desk, 
plotting space, charts showing the RCC’s area of responsibility and adjacent areas and filing space are 
needed. Use of various technologies may improve the RCC performance and affect the staffing and 
training requirements.

2.3.9 When a JRCC cannot be established, ARCCs and MRCCs may still be able to provide mutual

communications and staff support. Direct and close cooperation among RCCs should also minimize 
costs, enhance coordination and ensure the efficient use of resources.
2.3.10 The equipment of an RCC will be determined by the expected demands to be made on the RCC, and 
the extent of functions it should perform.
(a) Communications. Communications needs can sometimes be met by ATS channels, public

services, or installation of appropriate shore-based facilities for mobile satellite services. Reliable 
dedicated lines which can preserve message priority are preferred. In addition to telephone 
lines with published numbers, one telephone line should have an unlisted, confidential number 
to ensure the availability of one out-going line in situations where there are many incoming 
telephone calls. Use of the ICAO Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network (AFTN) or

Chapter 2 – System components
2-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
digital Aeronautical Fixed Network (AFN) can meet some communications needs and preserve 
message priority. All voice equipment, including telephones, should be attached to a multi-
channel tape recorder, preferably with a time recording. This allows the RCC to review verbal 
information. Arrangements can be made with the public telephone administration to ensure

that calls from originators who do not wish to cover the charges are passed without delay to 
the RCC on a collect or pre-paid reply basis. Such arrangements should be widely publicized 
to encourage outside sources to provide information on missing or distressed craft. Chapter 4 
summarizes the communications capability and equipment the RCC and RSC should have.
(b) Information. Ready access to operational information will help the SMC take immediate and

appropriate action in an emergency. Much of this information derives from the RCC plan of 
operations and SAR databases. Use of large-scale wall charts showing assigned SRRs and 
locations of resources along with a SAR facility status board or computer file reflecting the 
current status of all SAR facilities, telephone numbers, and other useful information, is practical. 
The chart or map should also show areas adjacent to the SRR. The map could display, by means

of coloured pins or other symbols, information of interest.
(c) Plotting facilities. The RCC and RSC should have a stock of maritime and aeronautical maps and 
charts, plotting equipment, and other information necessary for their use.
(d) Publications and supplies.  The publications and supplies to be available at the RCC will vary, 
but should include:
 – SAR publications of ICAO, IMO, the national and neighbouring SAR authorities;

– relevant State documents, e.g. Air Navigation Regulations and Notices to Mariners and, if 
considered necessary, those of adjacent States;
 – communications publications;
 – aeronautical information publications (AIPs);
 – indexes of names, addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers; and
 – relevant checklists and forms.
 Staffing
2.3.11 RCCs perform administrative and operational duties. Administrative duties, including planning,

cooperation with providers of facilities, exercises and case studies, are concerned with maintaining 
the RCC in a continuous state of preparedness. In areas of low SAR activity the administrative duties 
are of high importance since they are the best way to keep the staff in readiness for SAR cases. The 
administrative duties should be shared so that more than one person is capable of performing these

duties. Effective administrative actions help to ensure proficient SAR operations. SAR operations are 
the responsibility of the SMC and this responsibility may be met by the RCC chief or by other properly 
trained staff of the RCC. Personnel from services or organizations providing facilities can be used as 
part of the RCC team if they are duly trained and qualified. They will normally serve in support of

expert functions such as firefighting, or air or marine safety. The RCC must be prepared to undertake 
and continue operational duties 24 h per day. This level of readiness requires that multiple persons be 
trained and qualified to assume SMC duties.
(a) RCC chief. The RCC chief may be a person who also performs other functions. Whenever an 
RCC is established in conjunction with an ATS unit or similar operations centre, responsibilities

for the RCC are often placed on the chief of that facility. In such instances, another person 
should be appointed to handle day-to-day management of the RCC. The RCC chief must make 
appropriate preparations, plans, and arrangements as well as oversee, if not delegated, the 
daily operations of the RCC, to ensure that when an incident occurs the SAR operation can be 
promptly performed.
(b) RCC staff. The RCC staff consists of personnel who are trained and capable of planning and

Chapter 2 – System components
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 2-7
will vary with local requirements, traffic density, seasonal conditions, meteorological conditions 
and other SRR conditions. An RCC must be in a constant state of operational readiness. Where 
the RCC does not maintain continuous staffing, or only has one trained and capable RCC person 
on duty, provision must be made for stand-by RCC staff to be mobilized rapidly.

(c) SAR mission coordinator. An SMC should be designated for each specific SAR operation, and 
adequate numbers of personnel qualified to perform the SMC function must be readily available 
on a 24-hour basis. This is a temporary function which may be performed by the RCC chief or 
a designated SAR duty officer, assisted by as many staff as may be required. A SAR operation 
may continue over a prolonged period of time. The SMC is in charge of a SAR operation until

a rescue has been effected or until it has become apparent that further efforts would be of no 
avail. The RCC plan of operations should give the SMC the freedom to employ any facility, to 
request additional ones and to accept or reject any suggestions made during the operation. The 
SMC is responsible for planning the search and rescue operations and coordinating the transit 
of SAR facilities to and from the scene. SCs are not normally involved in the conduct of the SAR

operation. (Duties of the SMC are discussed further in the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission 
Coordination.) The number of persons to be available for assignment as SMC will depend on:
 – possible need to coordinate operations from a location other than the RCC, e.g. from 
available communications facilities;
 – expected frequency of SAR incidents, including the possibility of more than one incident 
occurring simultaneously;

occurring simultaneously;
 – size of the area and prevailing conditions (e.g. climate or topography); and
 – need to allow for vacation, training courses, illness, relief and travel.
 Training, qualification, and certification
2.3.12 Training and experience are crucial to proper SAR response.
(a) RCC chiefs, SMCs, and RCC staff need specific training in watchstanding, coordination of 
assorted resources, search planning, and rescue planning. SAR managers have the responsibility

to ensure that the overall training programme is effective. It will normally be the responsibility of 
the RCC chief to ensure that all SAR service personnel reach and maintain the required level of 
competence.
(b) Training in itself can provide only basic knowledge and skills. Qualification and certification 
processes are used to ensure that sufficient experience, maturity and judgement are gained.

During a qualification process, the individual must, by demonstration of abilities, show mental 
and physical competence to perform as part of a team. Certification is official recognition by 
the organization that it trusts the individual to use those abilities. Chapter 3 provides additional 
information on these and related topics.
 Plans of operation
2.3.13 Each RCC is responsible for preparing comprehensive plans for the conduct of SAR in its SRR

and for coordinated actions within adjacent SRRs. These plans must cover the whole SRR and be 
based on agreements between the SAR service and the providers of facilities or other support for 
SAR operations. Plans are intended to be valuable aids for time-critical search planning and SAR 
coordination processes. Each RCC and RSC should develop plans that:
 – meet the requirements of applicable international SAR manuals;
 – cover all the emergency scenarios likely to occur within the SRR;

Chapter 2 – System components
2-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
2.3.14 The plans of operation set out the details for the conduct of SAR at operational levels. The IAMSAR 
Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination contains an outline of plans of operation.
 Search and rescue regions
2.3.15 An SRR is an area of defined dimensions associated with an RCC within which SAR services are 
provided. ICAO RANPs depict aeronautical SRRs for most of the world. States have agreed to accept

SAR responsibility for an area which is composed of one or more aeronautical SRRs. Maritime SRRs are 
published in the IMO SAR Plan, and could be similar, or different, to aeronautical SRRs. The purpose 
of having an SRR is to clearly define who has primary responsibility for coordinating responses to 
distress situations in every area of the world and to enable rapid distribution of distress alerts to the

proper RCC. A State may have separate aeronautical and maritime SRRs, or separate SRRs in different 
ocean/sea areas; otherwise, a single SRR (with SRSs, if necessary) will usually suffice.
(a) Factors affecting SRR size and shape. When establishing or amending an SRR, States should try 
to create the most efficient system possible, bearing in mind that each SRR is part of a global 
system. Leading factors to consider should include:
 – size and shape of the area of responsibility;

– size and shape of the area of responsibility;
 – air and shipping traffic density and pattern;
 – availability, distribution, readiness and mobility of SAR resources;
 – reliability of the communications network; and
 – which State is fully capable, qualified, and willing to assume responsibility.
(b) Aeronautical SRRs often are aligned with FIRs for specific reasons.
 – The ATS unit providing flight information service for an FIR is the central point for collecting

and forwarding information about aircraft emergencies and coordinates SAR aircraft and 
other air traffic operating within the FIR.
 – Simplified notification, coordination and liaison between the RCC and the ATS unit.
 – Savings often result from sharing RCC and ATS staff, facilities, and communications networks.
(c) Upper flight information regions (UIRs) sometimes exist above a system of FIRs. UIRs generally 
are NOT used to define aeronautical SRRs for three reasons.

– Searches are generally conducted at low altitudes and must be coordinated with other 
traffic in the FIR.
 – ATS communications facilities useful for SAR, particularly air–ground facilities, are adapted 
to the FIR rather than to the UIR.
 – Territorial divisions of authority for local agencies used in SAR operations generally 
correspond to those of the FIRs.
(d) Experience shows that in most areas there are operational advantages in harmonizing aeronautical

and maritime SRRs. Doing so minimizes confusion over which authority is to be alerted when 
a distress situation arises at and over a specific geographic position. In order to enhance the 
efficiency of SAR services, neighbouring States should seek to agree on the limits of their SRRs 
which could enhance coordination and avoid duplication of efforts. To make them easier to use, 
SRR limits should, if possible, be straight lines running north to south or east to west between

well-defined geographic points. Such regions should be contiguous and as far as practicable not 
overlap.
(e) The delimitation of SRRs is not related to and shall not prejudice the delimitation of any 
boundary between States. An SRR is established solely to ensure that primary responsibility for 
coordinating SAR services for that geographic area is assumed by some State. SRR limits should 
not be viewed as barriers to assisting persons in distress. Any facility within a SAR organization

should respond to all distress situations whenever and wherever it is capable of doing so. In this 
respect, cooperation between States, their RCCs and their SAR services should be as c lose as 
possible.
(f) An SRR is established by agreement among States. States should propose establishing or amending 
SRR limits when this would result in the provision of more efficient or effective SAR services. The

States concerned should agree among themselves, formally or informally, on the lines separating 
their SRRs and then inform IMO or the applicable ICAO regional office, depending on whether 
the SRRs are maritime or aeronautical. After due process, the information will then be published 
in the IMO SAR plan or the applicable ICAO RANP . Sometimes SRR limits can be tentatively 
decided at an IMO SAR workshop or an ICAO regional air navigation meeting, subject to later 
approval.

approval.
2.4 Rescue sub-centres
2.4.1 There may be situations where an RCC is not able to exercise direct and effective control over SAR 
facilities in an area within its SRR. The establishment of an RSC with its SRS may be appropriate. 
Examples of such situations include:
 – where the communications facilities in a portion of an SRR are not adequate for close coordination 
between the RCC and SAR facilities;

between the RCC and SAR facilities;
 – where the SRR encompasses a number of States or territorial divisions of a State in which, for 
political or administrative reasons, local facilities can only be directed and controlled through 
designated local authorities; and
 – where local control of SAR operations will be more effective.
2.4.2 In such situations, the RCC may delegate some or all of its responsibility to an RSC, including

communications, search planning and arrangements for SAR facilities. An RSC may be as capable 
as an RCC. The more complicated the Administration or the poorer the communications, the greater 
the authority that should be delegated to the RSC. Its requirements in personnel, equipment and 
accommodations will then be similar to those of the RCC. However, RSCs typically have fewer 
responsibilities and capabilities than their associated RCC and their requirements in personnel,

equipment and accommodations are usually smaller.
2.4.3 An aeronautical RSC (ARSC) can be established for aeronautical SAR incidents, and a maritime RSC 
(MRSC) for maritime SAR incidents.
 Note:  The term RSC will be used within this Manual except where it applies only to aeronautical or 
maritime; then ARSC or MRSC will be used.
2.5 SAR facilities
2.5.1 SAR facilities include designated SRUs and other resources which can be used to conduct or support

SAR operations. An SRU is a unit composed of trained personnel and provided with equipment suitable 
for the expeditious and efficient conduct of search and rescue. An SRU can be an air, maritime, or 
land-based facility. Facilities selected as SRUs should be able to reach the scene of distress quickly 
and, in particular, be suitable for one or more of the following operations:
 – providing assistance to prevent or reduce the severity of accidents and the hardship of survivors,

respect, cooperation between States, their RCCs and their SAR services should be as c lose as 
possible.
(f) An SRR is established by agreement among States. States should propose establishing or amending 
SRR limits when this would result in the provision of more efficient or effective SAR services. The 
States concerned should agree among themselves, formally or informally, on the lines separating

their SRRs and then inform IMO or the applicable ICAO regional office, depending on whether 
the SRRs are maritime or aeronautical. After due process, the information will then be published 
in the IMO SAR plan or the applicable ICAO RANP . Sometimes SRR limits can be tentatively 
decided at an IMO SAR workshop or an ICAO regional air navigation meeting, subject to later 
approval.

2.4 Rescue sub-centres
2.4.1 There may be situations where an RCC is not able to exercise direct and effective control over SAR 
facilities in an area within its SRR. The establishment of an RSC with its SRS may be appropriate. 
Examples of such situations include:
 – where the communications facilities in a portion of an SRR are not adequate for close coordination

between the RCC and SAR facilities;
 – where the SRR encompasses a number of States or territorial divisions of a State in which, for 
political or administrative reasons, local facilities can only be directed and controlled through

 – where local control of SAR operations will be more effective.
2.4.2 In such situations, the RCC may delegate some or all of its responsibility to an RSC, including

communications, search planning and arrangements for SAR facilities. An RSC may be as capable 
as an RCC. The more complicated the Administration or the poorer the communications, the greater

2.4.3 An aeronautical RSC (ARSC) can be established for aeronautical SAR incidents, and a maritime RSC 
(MRSC) for maritime SAR incidents.
 Note:  The term RSC will be used within this Manual except where it applies only to aeronautical or 
maritime; then ARSC or MRSC will be used.
2.5 SAR facilities
2.5.1 SAR facilities include designated SRUs and other resources which can be used to conduct or support

SAR operations. An SRU is a unit composed of trained personnel and provided with equipment suitable 
for the expeditious and efficient conduct of search and rescue. An SRU can be an air, maritime, or 
land-based facility. Facilities selected as SRUs should be able to reach the scene of distress quickly 
and, in particular, be suitable for one or more of the following operations:
 – providing assistance to prevent or reduce the severity of accidents and the hardship of survivors,

Chapter 2 – System components
2-10 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
2.5.2 The equipment needed by SRUs may be grouped as shown.
(a) Communications. An SRU must have rapid and reliable means to communicate by voice or 
message with the SMC, the OSC if assigned, other SRUs, and the distressed persons. Chapter 4 
has more information on SRU communications requirements.
(b) Mobility. The effectiveness of a SAR service depends on the number, speed, location, and

efficiency of the aircraft, vessels and land vehicles available.
(c) Supplies and survival equipment. Supplies and survival equipment are carried by air and maritime 
SAR facilities to give aid to survivors and to facilitate their rescue. The type and number to be 
carried depend on the circumstances on scene. Maritime facilities and helicopters generally can 
deliver this equipment directly to survivors. Fixed-wing aircraft can deliver supplies to survivors

if suitable landing areas exist nearby or if the supplies can be dropped at the scene. The packing 
of supplies and survival equipment should be adapted to the manner of delivery. Containers 
and packages of supplies and survival equipment should be strong, of a highly visible colour, 
waterproof and buoyant. The general nature of their contents should be clearly indicated in 
print in English and additional languages appropriate to the intended area of operation or using

self-explanatory symbols and pictograms as discussed in appendix B. Supplies and survival 
equipment requirements must be adapted to the circumstances of the SRR in which they are 
used.
(d) Other equipment. Every SRU should have at its disposal maps, charts, plotting equipment, and 
information relevant to the SRR(s) in which it is likely to operate.
 Designated search and rescue units
2.5.3 States may wish to designate specific facilities as SRUs. These designated SRUs may be under the

direct jurisdiction of the SAR service or other State authorities or may belong to non-Governmental 
or voluntary organizations. In the latter situation, agreements between the SAR service and these 
organizations should be developed. SRUs need not be dedicated solely to SAR operations, but should 
have the training and equipment necessary for proficient operations.
 Specialized SAR units
2.5.4 Specialized SRUs are teams with specialized training and equipment created for specific rescue

scenarios; e.g. mountain or desert rescue. Agreements should be developed between the SAR service 
and these organizations for timely provision of their services.
 Other search and rescue facilities
2.5.5 In establishing a SAR service, States can use – to the fullest extent – existing facilities established for 
tasks not connected with SAR. Existing facilities often may be suitable for SAR operations with minimal

modifications, added equipment or additional crew training. Examples include: teaching look-out 
scanning techniques to volunteers and auxiliary organizations; installing radiotelephone equipment on 
fishing vessels, yachts and other small craft; and using isolated stations as alerting posts. By providing 
training, installing some low-cost equipment and integrating all facilities into the SAR system, an 
efficient SAR service can be set up with limited need for dedicated SRUs.

Medical advice and medical assistance
2.5.6 The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue provides for parties to the Convention 
to provide, on request from masters of ships, medical advice and initial medical assistance and, as 
required, to make arrangements for medical evacuations for patients. An RCC should establish a 
relationship with a maritime telemedical assistance service (TMAS) to ensure that medical advice can

be provided to masters at sea within its SRR 24 h a day. The RCC should have the means to coordinate 
medical assistance and evacuation in consultation with a TMAS. It is desirable to have a doctor or 
paramedic who has been briefed by the TMAS on board the evacuation craft. The RCC may establish 
contractual arrangements with a suitably recognized medical authority to provide this telemedical 
assistance service. A sample text of a contractual arrangement between an RCC and a TMAS is at

appendix N.
 Area of SAR action
2.5.7 During SAR operations the SAR aircraft involved should be able to carry out their activities without 
interference from other air activity. Additionally, aeronautical organizations and aircraft not involved 
in a SAR operation need to be made aware of it for their safety. The temporary establishment of 
appropriate areas surrounding SAR operations might improve safety and inform others of SAR activity.

2.5.8 An “Area of SAR Action” is an area of defined dimensions used or agreed by appropriate authorities 
for the protection of aircraft during SAR operations. It should be assumed that within areas of SAR 
action special flying procedures relevant to SAR operations might take place. Areas of SAR action are 
described in further detail in volume II, chapter 7 .
2.5.9 SAR organizations should arrange that RCC have methods in place for implementing areas of SAR

action to facilitate SAR operations.
2.6 On-scene coordinator (OSC) and aircraft coordinator (ACO)
2.6.1 When two or more SAR facilities are working together on the same mission, it is usually advantageous 
if one person is assigned to coordinate the activities of all participating facilities. The SMC designates 
this OSC, who may be the person in charge of an SRU, ship, or aircraft participating in a search,

or someone at another nearby facility able to handle OSC duties. The person in charge of the first 
SAR resource to arrive at the scene will normally assume the function of OSC until the SMC directs 
that the OSC function be transferred. Conceivably, the OSC may have to assume SMC duties and 
actually plan the search and/or rescue if the OSC becomes aware of a distress situation directly and 
communications cannot be established with an RCC. The OSC should be the most capable person

available, taking into consideration SAR training, communications capabilities and the length of time 
that the facility on which the OSC is aboard can stay in the search area. Frequent changes in the OSC 
should be avoided. When appropriate, an aircraft coordinator (ACO) may also be designated to assist 
with on-scene coordination of SAR aircraft.
2.6.2 Responsible authorities should find ways of training and exercising the OSC and ACO functions, both

for those who act in these roles and for those who cooperate closely with them.
 On-scene coordinator (OSC) and aircraft coordinator (ACO) joint training
2.6.3 The SAR management should provide OSC and ACO training between SRU crews from different 
organizations that might act as OSCs or ACOs. The training should improve understanding of the OSC 
and ACO roles and increase confidence amongst the participating SRUs.
2.6.4 OSC and ACO training can consist of:

 – duties of cooperating organizations;
 – performance characteristics of SRUs;
 – typical cases and methods;

2.7 Support facilities
2.7.1 Support facilities enable the operational response resources (e.g. the RCC and SRUs) to provide the 
SAR services. Without the supporting resources, the operational resources cannot sustain effective 
operations. There is a wide range of support facilities and services, which include the following:
 Training facilities    Facility maintenance
 Communications facilities   Management functions

Communications facilities   Management functions
 Navigation systems   Research and development
 SAR data providers (SDPs)   Planning
 Medical facilities    Exercises
 Aircraft landing fields    Refuelling services
 Voluntary services (e.g. Red Cross)   Critical incident stress counsellors
 Computer resources
2.7. 2 A SAR organization can benefit from use of computers by either possessing the capability, or in

many instances, knowing where and how to gain computer services and database support from 
other organizations, including support for specialized functions such as developing a search plan 
and gaining access to vessel tracking information such as AIS, LRIT, VMS used by fisheries and ship 
reporting systems (SRSs). Chapter 4 provides specific information on other sources of data. Additional 
information may be found in paragraph 1.11 of the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination.

2.7. 3 Large amounts of computing and data storage capability can be obtained at a relatively low cost. 
Modern software packages make development of helpful forms, calculations, databases and some 
communications reasonably easy and inexpensive. Many such aids can be developed locally and do 
not require any specialized expertise. A basic low-cost personal computer can assist the RCC in its 
daily administrative functions and also be used for search planning. More sophisticated computers

can provide rapid analysis and forecasts of search effectiveness, environmental data, and other search 
planning aids.
2.7.4 Databases can perform a number of useful functions. Most databases hold detailed information 
which can be quickly accessed, used and also consolidated into reports. SAR managers can use 
this for SAR system management support, including budget efforts and the RCC can use it for search

planning. Environmental databases, including weather and maritime currents, are maintained by 
numerous academic, oceanographic, military, scientific and meteorological organizations which may 
make them available for search planning. The SAR system has a growing global network of SAR data 
providers (SDPs) available to States. The International Telecommunication Union has information for

identifying mobile radio stations which transmit distress alerts. Cospas-Sarsat also maintains registration 
databases with basic SAR information. These databases rely upon States to submit timely and correct 
information. Examples of other databases include Inmarsat numbers, call signs (C/S), maritime mobile 
service identity (MMSI) numbers and shipping registers. When such databases are implemented, the

data should be made readily available on a 24-hour basis to any RCC in receipt of a distress alert.
2.7. 5 The SAR system greatly benefits from using all available facilities. Appendix C provides a list of possible 
sources for SAR assistance.
 SAR refuelling facilities
2.7.6 In parts of an SRR without refuelling facilities, SAR organizations should arrange that RCC have 
alternative plans for refueling SRUs in place.

Chapter 3
Training, qualification, certification and exercises
3.1 Building professionalism
3.1.1 A good training programme produces true professionals, personnel who can do it right the first time. 
The purpose of training is to meet SAR system objectives by developing SAR specialists.
3.1.2 Since considerable experience and judgement are needed to handle typical SAR situations, necessary

skills require significant time to master. Training can be expensive. Poor training is even more expensive 
and can result in poor operational effectiveness, which can result in loss of lives of SAR personnel, 
lives of those in distress and loss of valuable facilities. Quality of performance will match the quality 
of training. Efforts to ensure professionalism may even extend to career development actions prior

to assignment to SAR duties, ensuring SAR assignments of sufficient length to develop expertise and 
taking advantage of SAR experience in subsequent assignments.
 Training
3.1.3 Training is critical to performance and safety. The SAR system should save those in distress when 
it can, and also use training to reduce risks to its own valuable personnel and facilities. Training 
personnel in making sound risk assessments will help to ensure that these trained professionals and

valuable facilities remain available for future operations. More on the content and process of training 
is contained within section 3.2.
 Qualification
3.1.4 The purpose of qualification is to validate an individual’s ability to perform certain duties. It is a 
minimum level of knowledge and skills which should be required to be correctly demonstrated. This 
validation activity may take place at a specific position, while maintaining specific equipment or

performed as a team member within a unit. Qualification is not designed as a training programme but 
can result in training. Qualification procedures demonstrate the capability to perform specific tasks. A 
qualification programme covers fundamental knowledge necessary for the duties of that position and 
testing of individuals on the systems they will be required to operate or maintain.
 Certification

Certification
3.1.5 The purpose of certification is to authorize an individual to serve in a stated capacity. Certificates 
may be issued to candidates who meet the requirements for service, age, medical fitness, training, 
qualification, examinations and maturity. Certification should be in writing prior to the person assuming 
watchstanding duties.
3.1.6 Training alone can provide only basic knowledge and skills. Qualification and certification processes

are used to ensure sufficient experience, maturity and judgement are gained. During a qualification 
process, the individual must, by demonstration of abilities, show mental and physical competence 
to perform as part of a team. Certification is official recognition by the organization that it trusts the 
individual to use those abilities. Detailed qualification requirements vary with each type of workplace

Chapter 3 – Training, qualification, certification and exercises
3-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
3.1.7 The person in charge should believe that a qualified person has the maturity, leadership and integrity 
to perform as a team member before issuing a certificate, the final step leading to full assumption 
of duties. Persons who have been through the qualification process are the best source of ideas for

improving it. Training and qualification improve operational effectiveness, create a feeling of fairness, 
reduce accidents and reduce complaints against the organization.
3.1.8 The RCC and RSC have particularly important duties. Upon completion of training, the prospective 
RCC watchstander should undergo qualification procedures. RCC staff should be fully qualified in 
SAR incident analysis, search planning and SAR operations management.

Note: The term “certification” is widely used by IMO, ICAO, and other organizations within the context 
of authorizing personnel or facilities to perform certain functions. In this chapter, “certification” is 
similarly used to authorize that a properly trained and qualified person can perform assigned tasks.
3.2 Training specifics
 Who to train
3.2.1 All SAR specialists need training, in particular, the SCs, RCC chiefs, SMCs, RCC staff, OSCs, ACOs and 
SRUs.

SRUs.
3.2.2 Operational facilities which need training include:
 – RCCs and RSCs;
 – aeronautical units;
 – maritime units;
 – land units; 
 – specialized units (pararescue, paramedical, desert rescue, mountain rescue, urban SAR teams 
that deploy to disasters, divers, etc.); and
 – supply depots. 
3.2.3 An individual, a group or multiple groups may be trained. Each person should have had previous

training to perform individual tasks. Where the individuals integrate into teams, team training is 
required so that the individuals can support the team effort. Where teams integrate, multiple team 
training is required to support the overall effort. An example of multiple team training is SRUs training 
together.
3.2.4 The aviation and maritime communities require training in distress prevention, escape procedures,

survival techniques, how to be located and actions to be taken to assist in one’s own rescue. This 
training may focus on individuals or groups. Such training may be provided by the industry or company 
involved. It may also be provided by public and private education efforts for safety awareness.
3.2.5 RCC and RSC watchstanders usually need formal SAR training. If unable to immediately attend formal

training, they must receive a period of on-the-job training and an interim qualification and certification.
 What to train
3.2.6 An individual’s training must be based on a needs analysis. This analysis compares actual performance 
and behaviour with required performance and behaviour at a currently held position. Based on this 
analysis, training needs and methods to overcome the deficiencies can be identified.

3.2.7 The need for a working knowledge of the English language may be considered. RCCs must be able to 
communicate with other RCCs, as well as ship masters and aircraft commanders, who are required to be 
able to speak English. Air traffic services units also have requirements for English language speaking skills.
3.2.8 The present skill of a person can also be compared with the required competency which will be

Chapter 3 – Training, qualification, certification and exercises
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 3-3
3.2.9 Planning for future training needs can be more effective if knowledge and skills which will be needed 
due to changing technology can be predicted.
3.2.10 Training of SAR service personnel can include the following:
 – study of the application of SAR procedures, techniques and equipment through lectures, 
demonstrations, films, and SAR manuals and journals;

– assisting in or observing actual operations; and
 – exercises in which personnel are trained to coordinate individual procedures and techniques in 
a simulated operation.
3.2.11 RCC and RSC SAR training should include at least the following topics. If search planning expertise 
gained from formal training is not used on a regular basis for operations or exercises, periodic refresher 
training will normally be needed. General categories include:
Aeronautical drift Mass rescue operations

Aeronautical drift Mass rescue operations
Aircraft coordinator duties Medical advice
AFN Medical evacuations
AFTN Obtain and evaluate data
Autonomous distress tracking On-scene coordinator duties
Bailout scenarios and planning Parachute drift
Briefing/questioning SRUs Plotting skills
Case studies Registration databases
Charts Rescue procedures
Coastal SAR planning Resource allocation
Computer applications Risk assessment
Cospas-Sarsat SAR agreements
Datum determination SAR communications

Evaluation of flare sightings Search patterns
Fatigue factors Search planning
IMO-recognized mobile satellite services

3.2.12 SAR managers performing administrative functions may benefit from courses in:
 – planning;
 – organizing;
 – staffing; and
 – budgeting, performance assessment and accounting.
3.2.13 Operating a facility in a SAR environment, such as stormy weather, may be a special skill not generally 
learned, and may be considered for specialized training facilities.
 When to train

When to train
3.2.14 Training is most beneficial when it is accomplished before a specialist is assigned to duties requiring 
that training. It matches the duties to be performed and is generally provided at three levels.
(a) Entry level for those specialists just entering the organization.
(b) Current level for those specialists who must remain at a certain level of proficiency to continue 
with their present position. This also includes any updating due to technical and equipment

improvements.
(c) Advanced level for those specialists who have proven performance in a current position and 
desire or need to advance.
3.2.15 Training may focus on awareness and knowledge at the SAR manager level; knowledge and performance 
at the middle (RCC chief) management level; and performance at the operational management level 
(to include training of the SRU crew). There are various models of training management which seek to

identify specific training requirements and match the appropriate training process.
 Where to train
3.2.16 Training can be accomplished in a range of locations, from on-the-job site to a formal training centre. 
The student can be trained where work is normally accomplished, or can be transferred to another 
site for on-the-job training. Formal training can take place at a dedicated facility, or in a classroom

adjacent to the work site. The location is determined by cost-effective use of available facilities and 
training staff or experts. Sometimes training received from other reputable organizations, even in 
other States, can meet needs very well. Normally, it is better not to depend totally on training facilities 
or visiting teams from other States, because availability of such training can be limited, unpredictable,

expensive and only partly relevant. Sometimes, language differences can also reduce the effectiveness 
of training provided by other States.
 How to train
3.2.17 There are three ways to train.
(a) Training based on performance helps SAR specialists and teams to perform their duties effectively. 
The SAR manager has the responsibility to ensure that the overall training programme is effective. 
The RCC chief and others must ensure that all SAR service personnel reach and maintain the

required level of competence.
(b) Training based on knowledge provides information necessary for the SAR experts and students 
to perform their duties. One method is to provide knowledge to enable them to review SAR 
cases. Resulting recommendations can be used to review policy, update standard procedures, 
and improve training and other processes.
(c) Awareness training is required for those persons infrequently involved in SAR, such as high-level

Chapter 3 – Training, qualification, certification and exercises
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 3-5
3.2.19 On-the-job training. With on-the-job training, trainees learn and, at the same time, contribute to the 
aims of the organization. This economical approach requires competent specialists who can teach 
and coach trainees.
(a) Checklists. Training specialists develop checklists of job duties, skills, tasks, and procedures to be

taught through on-the-job training. This ensures that all trainees receive the same information. 
Items on the checklist can typically be covered in any order.
(b) Planned progression. This technique gives SAR specialists a clear idea where they are going. 
The specialist knows the requirements for advancement and the means to achieve it. Planned 
progression is a step-by-step approach which requires tasks to be performed well at each level 
before proceeding to the next level.

before proceeding to the next level.
(c) Assignment rotation. This broadens the knowledge of specialists. Rotation to different jobs allows 
the specialist to understand broader aspects of the organization.
(d) Coaching. This is the responsibility of every specialist in a management position. Effective 
coaches develop the strengths and potential of subordinates and help them overcome their 
weaknesses. Coaching saves time, money and costly mistakes by subordinates.

(e) Library. A training library is useful for students to increase their level of knowledge. Libraries 
can include different materials such as videos, lesson plans, reference books and papers, and 
audio recordings. Videos can be made by simply recording good classroom training sessions. A 
professionally produced video can be even more effective.
3.2.20 Formal classroom training. Many facilities now conduct courses, workshops, conferences and other

programmes for training SAR specialists. For persons who will serve as SAR managers, or who will 
serve as maritime administrators with SAR management duties, the IMO World Maritime University 
teaches courses on SAR organization and operations. The model materials for the course are available 
from IMO. The University in Malmö, Sweden, can be contacted about class information. IMO and 
ICAO can also refer inquiries about the availability for formal SAR training available for foreign students

to States which offer such training. In some cases, sources of financial assistance for foreign students 
may be IMO, ICAO or other international and State sources.
(a) Train-the-trainer. When a person must travel abroad to receive formal SAR training, it may be 
more cost-effective if arrangements are made for the person to also observe use of the procedures 
in real operations, and to learn how to teach them. States could then make maximum use of

this person upon return to conduct well-planned and organized training within the home State 
or region. Part of the SAR training strategy should be to train individuals in such a way that they 
can help train others where they work. This reduces the reliance on formal training centres and 
the burden of training costs.
(b) Maintain a training facility. A formal training facility within the State or region helps to maintain

professionalism and standardization. Sending students long distances for training is costly and 
inefficient and courses may include irrelevant topics. Importing formal training from other nations 
has mostly short-term benefits and is seldom possible on a consistent and reliable basis. Local 
trainers understand local needs best, can provide an ongoing programme and are particularly 
useful when a language difference could be a problem.

(c) Add to curriculum. Usually the most economical and effective way to provide formal SAR 
training is to add SAR to the curriculum of an existing training centre. The staff might be jointly 
provided by organizations that use the training, providing good cross-exposure for instructors 
and students. For aeronautical SAR, it is particularly useful to have staff expertise in maritime 
and land SAR since rescues must be carried out within both environments.

Chapter 3 – Training, qualification, certification and exercises
3-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
3.3 Exercises
3.3.1 Exercises test and improve operational plans, provide learning experience and improve liaison and 
coordination skills. Exercises, conducted on a realistic basis, help to demonstrate and assess the true 
effectiveness of training and the operational efficiency and competence of the SAR service. Exercises

will reveal deficiencies that may exist in SAR plans and enable them to be improved. It is safer to 
have shortcomings revealed by exercises rather than during actual operations. Appendix O provides 
a sample template to serve as a guide to assist a State to develop a SAR exercise with its local SAR 
supporting agencies as well as with one or more neighbouring States.
 Types of exercises
3.3.2 Exercises can and should be conducted on three levels.

(a) The most simple type of exercise, a communications exercise , requires the least planning. It 
consists of periodic use of all means of communications between all potential users to ensure 
capability for actual emergencies.
(b) A coordination exercise  involves simulated response to a crisis based on a series of scenarios. 
All levels of the SAR service are involved but do not deploy. This type of exercise requires 
considerable planning, and usually one to three days to execute.

(c) The third type, a full-scale exercise  or a field exercise , differs from the previous types in that 
actual SAR facilities are deployed. This increases the scope of SAR system-testing and adds 
realistic constraints due to times involved in launching, transit and activities of the SRUs.
 Other considerations
3.3.3 The need for exercises varies. Some States have many SAR operations so exercises may add little

to their learning experience, except when conducted with other States with which they may not 
routinely work. Other States may have very few SAR operations each year, so exercises will be critical 
to sustaining proficiency. Joint exercises among neighbouring States or parties to SAR agreements will 
also be valuable. It may be necessary to assign persons full-time to planning and evaluating exercises. 
Success of an exercise is measured by:
 – how many problems are discovered;

– how many problems are discovered;
 – how much is learned;
 – how much operating plans are improved; and
 – how few mistakes are repeated during the next exercise.
 Exercise elements
3.3.4 Successful exercises require planning, execution and evaluation. Exercises are carried out for training, 
to evaluate established plans and procedures and to test new concepts. Exercises also offer experience 
in the management of risks and safety for SAR operations.

3.3.5 Planning. The typical exercise sequence involves: development of the concept (broad goals and 
objectives) of what is to be exercised; selection of participants (staff and facilities); detailed planning 
for how the exercise will be conducted; conduct of the exercise; and evaluation to determine lessons 
learned and to develop recommendations for improvement. It is essential to have a clear understanding

of which plans and procedures are being exercised. Scenarios can then be developed that include 
specific situations to which personnel will react and respond. Response, or lack of response, to 
established policy and guidance, and need for additional policy guidance, is evaluated.
3.3.6 Execution. Those who plan exercises should not be the same ones who respond to the created 
scenarios. This avoids covering up known weaknesses to ensure ideal results, instead of revealing

Chapter 3 – Training, qualification, certification and exercises
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 3-7
it and general considerations of economy. If primary responsibility for SAR has been delegated 
to military authorities or Government services, full-scale exercises involving as many units and 
facilities as possible may provide satisfactory means of implementing training programmes. 
Where private concerns are relied upon to play a major part in SAR, the timing of major exercises

should be arranged so as to minimize disruption to normal activities.
(b) Opportunities should be taken to complement formal training programmes with exercises 
conducted on a unit basis by combining them with normal activities during quiet periods. They 
should be carried out at regular intervals and arranged so that all personnel participate. This is 
particularly important in respect of those facilities which seldom receive operational calls.

(c) Exercises carried out separately by facilities will not be as valuable as combined operations, but 
they can ensure that the SAR service will function in an emergency.
(d) As many facilities, including air and surface craft, should be exercised as possible. Communications 
between the SRUs is a vital test of coordination.
(e) It is not always practicable for organizations to engage in formal SAR training programmes.

Whenever possible, personnel from these organizations should be invited to participate in or 
observe training exercises. They should be provided with documents, publications or other 
literature which describe the SAR policies and procedures used by the SAR service, showing the 
desired roles of the participating organizations in SAR operations.
(f) Adjacent RCCs should periodically execute SAR exercises together to develop and maintain

efficient cooperation and coordination between their services. These exercises need not always 
be on a large scale, but at least those SAR units which are likely to operate together should 
engage periodically in coordinating exercises. Much may be learned by exchanging information 
on training methods (e.g. programmes, literature, and films) and visits between staff of adjacent 
SRRs.
(g) Safety requirements, particularly when using live “survivors”, may impose significant constraints

on the conduct of SAR exercises. SAR coordinating authorities should ensure that specific safety 
rules and limitations are issued for use during both the planning and conduct of SAR exercises.
3.3.7 Evaluation. The evaluation process is crucial. Inputs should come from a team of evaluation experts 
who observe the exercise, and from the people who actually participated in the exercise scenarios. 
Those observing and evaluating the response must have expertise in the areas they are evaluating,

and clearly understand what is being evaluated. The evaluators should know the situations being 
posed and then record the participant’s response to the objectives of the exercise. The final step is 
identification of weaknesses and development of recommendations for improvement. Subsequent 
exercises would emphasize these recommended changes as well as other concerns.
 Reports

Communications
4.1 Introduction
4.1.1 Communication consists of a sender passing information to a receiver by various means. SAR 
personnel, survivors, RCCs and RSCs, SAR facilities, and many others must have the means to be 
senders and receivers. SAR managers must seek to provide the essential communications elements 
to receive distress alerts and perform the SAR mission. Also, they should promote use of appropriate

alerting equipment by those who may need SAR services.
4.1.2 Necessary communications for SAR may include telephones, radios operating on international distress 
frequencies, long-range terrestrial and satellite systems, and other equipment, depending upon 
geography, the capabilities of mobile facilities within that area, and other factors affecting the ability 
of persons to contact each other.

of persons to contact each other.
4.1.3 Several reference documents and specific systems are referred to in this chapter. Appendix D contains 
information on how to contact sponsoring organizations for copies of the documents or for more 
information.
4.1.4 Supplemental communications information may also be found as follows:
 – chapter 3 of this volume discusses building personnel competence;
 – chapter 6 of this volume discusses ways to improve communications;

– the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination, has information on how communication 
services are actually used for distress alerting and SAR coordination; and
 – the IAMSAR Manual, volume III, Mobile Facilities, explains use of communications on scene.
4.2 Basic functions and requirements
4.2.1 Communications support distress alerting, coordination, and locating functions by allowing:
 – those in distress to alert the SAR system;

– those in distress to alert the SAR system;
 – the SAR system to respond and conduct its mission; and
 – survivors to help SAR units respond and conduct a rescue.
4.2.2 General operating requirements for SAR communications include the following.
(a) Timely delivery of alerts . Fast delivery of alert messages to the RCC responsible to respond 
to a distress alert is crucial for successful rescues. Alerts from aeronautical or maritime

communications equipment must be passed to the responsible RCC directly and quickly. This 
should be increasingly achieved as IMO and ICAO SAR Plans continue to improve.
(b) Complete and easy to understand alerts . Information in all pre-formatted data alert message 
fields must be complete, accurate and easy to understand. Alerts with coded or missing data, 
wrong aircraft or vessel identities or positions, false alerts, etc., are detrimental to life-saving.

Chapter 4 – Communications
4-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
reliable to only generate alerts in real distress situations, and the alert should not require any 
special time, effort or training on the part of the RCC to interpret. Communications data to 
support SAR must be consistent, complete, and if possible, delivered along with or shortly after 
the associated alert. Information on emergency contacts on land is often critical. Equipment for

distress alerting must be registered from when it is installed.
(c) Minimum number of false alerts. False alerts are any alerts received by the SAR system which 
indicate an actual or potential distress situation when no such situation actually exists. Some 
causes of false alerts include equipment malfunctions, interference, testing, and inadvertent 
human error. A false alert transmitted deliberately is called a hoax. As more alerting equipment

transmits automatic pre-formatted data messages, there will be a tendency for the numbers of 
false alerts to increase. If counter-measures are not developed, this will place increasing strain 
on the SAR system, bring increasing risk to SAR personnel, and harm the credibility of alerting 
systems needed to inform the SAR system when help is needed. It is essential that SAR personnel 
treat every distress alert as genuine until they know differently. Appendix E discusses steps that

SAR managers can take to reduce false alerts.
(d) Capability to contact units in distress. If the vessel or aircraft sending an alert is still operational, 
an RCC should be able to contact it directly or via an appropriate communications facility on 
the same equipment it used to contact the RCC (except for ELT and EPIRB alerts). This contact is 
needed for acknowledgement and subsequent two-way communications to obtain information

to support SAR planning and operations. If an alert is received either via satellite services or ATS 
from an ELT or EPIRB, the survivors may have lost all other means of alerting.
(e) Common language. The need for RCC staff and SAR unit crews to be proficient in speaking, 
writing and comprehending a common language to ensure effective information transfer is vital 
to successful conduct of SAR operations. In the case of a SAR action involving cooperative

input from a number of RCCs and SRUs within a region, the most convenient language may 
be a common regional language. In the case of a SAR action likely to extend beyond regional 
areas, the appropriate common language is English. English, in any case, serves as the default 
SAR operational language in all cross-boundary operations where there is no other common 
language. Defining and mandating specific levels of proficiency in languages for RCC staff

and SRU crews is, however, impractical because the regulatory framework of SAR services 
is insufficiently robust to support its implementation and maintenance. SAR service providers 
should, nonetheless, appreciate that where there is dependence upon spoken communication, 
mistaken transfer of operational information has been shown to be the most common causal 
factor in the occurrence of accidents and incidents and that every effort should be made to

mitigate its risks by requiring SAR staff to attain a high level of appropriate language proficiency. 
As supportive tools, in undertaking coordination across language barriers, SAR service providers 
may take advantage of commercial interpretation services that are now readily available. 
Confirmation of verbal conversations with facsimile or other written messages can reduce 
misunderstandings and expedite coordination processes.

4.2.3 Publications which can be used to alleviate language barriers between vessels, aircraft, survivors, and 
SAR personnel include: the International Code of Signals, the Standard Marine Communication Phrases 
(SMCP) and appendix I, “SITREPs and MAREC Codes” of the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission 
Coordination. These documents should be included in RCC libraries and be understood by the staff

who should be able to recognize coded messages based on these references. Ships should carry these 
documents and SRUs should carry the Code.
4.2.4 While tools like the International Code of Signals and SMCP are readily available and can be 
genuinely useful, they should not be thought of as total solutions for the challenges of communicating 
effectively across language barriers. Because of the range of topics and behaviours requiring common

understanding, effective transfer of information in situations of operational emergency is dependent 
upon a very comprehensive command of language. Thus, no form of standardized phraseology or 
code can address the extent of need. A high level of proficiency in common (or plain) language is 
necessary.
4.3 Important factors for SAR communications
 The following sections discuss some of the important factors that affect the quality and usefulness of 
communications.

communications.
 Priority, reliability, and availability
4.3.1 To reduce delays and improve the value of communications, systems must be improved on an end-to-
end basis. What matters is the overall timeliness and quality of communications from their source 
to final destinations. Therefore, all sea, land, air and space segments must be examined to eliminate 
weak links, delays and deterioration of quality.

weak links, delays and deterioration of quality.
4.3.2 Priority or precedence deals with the process of handling messages and other communication signals 
related to SAR. In particular, distress messages should always have precedence, i.e. be processed 
before all other communications.
4.3.3 Reliability is a measure of whether equipment and systems used by persons in distress and providers 
of SAR services are in good working condition whenever they are needed. Because of the time-critical

nature of SAR services, communications must work well at all times.
4.3.4 Availability refers to the SAR providers’ access to equipment. Not only must the equipment work well, 
but it must also be available to all parties involved at all times.
 Interoperability
4.3.5 Communications must be able to take place reliably and quickly between units in distress and the 
SAR system, and between components of the SAR system, nationally and internationally. For this

interoperability, every civil vessel and aircraft should have basic alerting equipment which will be 
effective for the area in which they operate. States then need to arrange for associated land-based 
infrastructure to receive, process and route distress alerts quickly to the appropriate place in the SAR 
system and for available communications databases to support alerts which are data rather than voice.

Sometimes systems which are not directly interoperable with each other can still, through indirect 
arrangements, be interlinked.
4.3.6 Interoperability is also important when SAR equipment and personnel are drawn from different 
functional areas. Ships must be able to communicate with aircraft, and both must be able to 
communicate with the SAR system. Coordination which depends on communications is essential

among all involved with a SAR effort. All who may be involved with SAR should be provided with 
communications procedures, frequencies and equipment sufficiently compatible to carry out their 
duties. Special switching equipment can be employed to link means of communications which 
otherwise are not interoperable.
 Identification
4.3.7 All radio transmission sources must be identifiable. There are many ways to identify a station calling

or being called, depending mostly on the equipment used; sometimes there are multiple alternatives 
for the same station. The specific identity received with a call or message, e.g. a radio call sign or 
identification number, is the one usually used in returning the call. SAR authorities should work with 
their State’s communications authorities to ensure that provisions are available so that all callers and 
message originators can be properly identified.
 Geography

Geography
4.3.8 Geography should also be considered in setting up a communications system. Terrain, distances and 
other geographic factors can limit the types of equipment or methods which will be effective. Local 
knowledge and tests are the best sources of reliable information on geographic factors. Longer-range 
communications may allow neighbouring States or authorities to share fixed facilities. Also, landline

 International coordination
4.3.9 Traditionally, States have independently developed shoreside and ground communications infrastructure 
to handle distress alerting and SAR. Coordination of modern communications on a regional or even 
global basis has become increasingly important to success. With the advent of long-range and 
satellite communications, automatic data alerting and messages which require international access to

databases to decode, this traditional approach is less effective. National stand-alone communications 
have become:
 – increasingly expensive;
 – prone to gaps and redundancies in coverage; and
 – inadequate to provide the seamless integration and databases needed to serve the interests of 
persons, aircraft and vessels in distress.
 Available technology
4.3.10 Many types of communications systems and equipment are available. Basic communications may

be all that are needed to provide SAR services; sophisticated and expensive systems may not be the 
most effective. However, technological advances, like the Internet and low earth orbit satellites, are 
providing potential low-cost alternatives to older systems. Persons in distress may use any means 
available to call for help. If a system gains public popularity, the SAR system should accommodate

(not necessarily encourage) its use where practicable. Cellular telephones, low-power mobile satellite 
equipment, paging systems, amateur radios, and portable computers are examples.
4.3.11 SAR personnel should be aware of capabilities and limitations of the various modern means of 
communications being developed which could be used for distress alerting and SAR. If a new system 
is being developed, consideration should be given to its intended use for emergencies, so that its

alerting, SAR coordination and locating capabilities can possibly be influenced while the system is 
easier to change. Appendix F suggests some capabilities which new satellite systems can incorporate 
to benefit users and the SAR system.
4.4 Mobile equipment
4.4.1 Mobile equipment is used by persons in distress and SAR facilities for distress communications.
4.4.2 Distress communications are used when immediate assistance is required by persons, aircraft, or marine

craft in distress, which may include medical assistance. Distress traffic also includes time-critical SAR 
communications and on-scene communications. Distress calls take absolute priority over all other 
transmissions; anyone receiving a distress call must immediately cease any transmissions which may 
interfere with the call and listen on the frequency used for the call.
4.4.3 More information on aeronautical and maritime mobile services, including communications between

vessels and aircraft, is provided in appendix G.
 Equipment used by persons in distress
4.4.4 Any available means may be used for distress alerting. Often people use equipment which was never 
intended for alerting, and is less than ideal for that purpose, such as mobile phones. However, as 
illustrated below, some vessels and aircraft are subject to international carriage requirements for 
distress communications.

distress communications.
(a) Most civil aircraft operating over ocean areas and remote land areas, and many other aircraft, 
are required to carry the 406 MHz distress beacon called an emergency locator transmitter 
(ELT). Designated SAR aircraft should be able to home on ELT 121.5 and 406 MHz signals for 
locating a distress scene and survivors. 
(b) Similarly, certain vessels must carry the 406 MHz distress beacon called an emergency position-

Chapter 4 – Communications
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 4-5
EPIRBs are also provided with a 121.5 MHz beacon primarily for homing by aircraft. EPIRBs 
installed on or after 1 July 2022 will also be provided with an AIS locating signal.
(c) Some ships may carry radios for use in survival craft capable of transmitting and receiving on the 
frequency 2182 kHz (radiotelephony). Some vessels may also carry portable survival craft VHF

transceivers. Appendix G provides more information on carriage requirements for SOLAS ships.
(d) The 406 MHz personal locator beacon (PLB) is not a mandated international carriage requirement, 
but may be carried on a person and has similar characteristics to the ELT and EPIRB distress 
beacons.  However, the PLB has different specifications.
4.4.5 Alerts are often received with missing or inaccurate position information. Location information allows

SRUs to be dispatched to the immediate vicinity of the distress; while direction-finding or homing 
devices, if available, lead the SRU directly to the distressed persons.
4.4.6 For operations, accurate position information received with the 406 MHz distress beacon alert, such 
as might be provided with the navigation capabilities of an integrated Global Navigation Satellite 
System (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), should not be considered an adequate

substitute for locating signals. GPS positions are often sufficient, but without comparably precise 
navigation equipment aboard search facilities, or in situations involving low visibility, direction finding 
or homing are still useful and sometimes essential.
 Search and rescue units
4.4.7 Equipment provided to be carried aboard designated SRUs should be able to support coordination 
and locating functions.

and locating functions.
4.4.8 Suitable means should be provided within an SRR to determine positions, especially over land and 
in coastal areas, including land-based radar for aircraft, vessel traffic services systems, etc. If there is 
any way to confirm the position reported in an alert, it would be prudent to do so, especially with 
initial 406 MHz distress beacon alerts via Cospas-Sarsat which may provide an “A” position and a “B”

position that indicates either one could be the true position and the other is an image position.
4.4.9 Lines of position (LOPs) can be obtained from direction-finding (DF) equipment within range of radio 
or other compatible signals. Two or more LOPs can be used to estimate the position of an aircraft or 
vessel. DF equipment can be effective on land or installed aboard SRUs.
4.4.10 There are also a variety of satellite systems used for navigation and for finding search objects. With

three-dimensional capability and high accuracy, the GNSS, e.g. GPS or GLONASS, is attractive for 
aeronautical applications.
 Note:  Civil uses of the worldwide GPS system are coordinated by the US Coast Guard, which can 
provide more information on the system, and, for GLONASS, by the Russian Space Forces.
4.4.11 Designated SAR aircraft should be able to communicate on common maritime frequencies. Also,

since most aeronautical and maritime survival craft equipment operates on 121.5 MHz AM, SAR and 
military aircraft should be able to use this frequency for voice communications.
4.4.12 SAR authorities may also provide SRUs with:
 – ability to operate on the frequencies 3023 kHz, 4125 kHz, 5680 kHz, 121.5 MHz, 123.1 MHz, 
and 2182 kHz;
 – AIS to detect the AIS search and rescue transmitter (AIS–SART) and/or search and rescue radar 
transponder (SART)-compatible 9 GHz radars;

Chapter 4 – Communications
4-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
4.5 Land-based infrastructure
4.5.1 The reliability and availability of the communications network which supports distress communications 
should be considered on an end-to-end basis. Often the land-based infrastructure is the weakest link 
in SAR communications, especially for maritime SAR.
 Alerting posts
4.5.2 “Alerting post” is a broad term which covers any facility, regardless of its primary purpose, involved in

receiving information about an apparent distress situation and relaying it to an RCC or RSC. Alerting 
posts include, but are not limited to:
 – coast radio stations (CRSs);
 – Cospas-Sarsat local user terminals (LUTs) and mission control centres (MCCs);
 – shore-based facilities for IMO-recognized mobile satellite services;
 – air traffic services (ATS) units; and
 – vessels, aircraft, or other persons or facilities which may receive and relay alerts.

4.5.3 The ability of an RCC to respond to an emergency depends largely on information forwarded via 
alerting posts. Cospas-Sarsat receives and processes alert information from ELTs, EPIRBs and personal 
locator beacons (PLBs). Flight information centres (FICs) or aeronautical area control centres (ACCs) 
receive alerts directly from aircraft or via other facilities. CRSs receive alerts from broadcasts or ships.

4.5.4 Communications between an alerting post and the RCC, RSC or local SAR unit should be by fast and 
reliable means. The channels should be checked regularly. These voice or data links could be via 
dedicated or public telephone, radiotelephone, radiotelegraph, or satellite.
 SAR communications network
4.5.5 Communications used among SAR facilities depend upon local arrangements, the structure of SAR

services within the SRR and available equipment. Suitable frequency capabilities to communicate 
with dedicated SRUs or other mobile SAR facilities should be selected from those authorized by 
the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU’s) Radio Regulations or ICAO Annex 10, provided 
and covered in plans or agreements among parties concerned. This includes advance international 
agreement on what frequencies will be used on scene when units of more than one State jointly

respond to a distress situation. SAR managers should ensure that such arrangements exist and that 
their RCC staff know about them.
4.5.6 Communications to and from RCCs and RSCs should be as timely and reliable as possible, and 
sufficient to handle the diversity and volume of communications for the worst potential scenarios. 
Specific details are provided in the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination.

4.5.7 Land-based communications infrastructure should be adapted to route all distress communications 
to or from the RCC as automatically and directly as possible. It is operationally important for SAR 
managers to obtain national authority for their RCCs and RSCs to directly respond to requests for 
assistance from persons or craft in distress or from other RCCs or RSCs; related communications 
should be routed directly to the RCC or RSC rather than via diplomatic channels.

4.5.8 In general, if an RCC is capable of performing all primary RCC functions and is listed along with its 
SRR in an ICAO regional air navigation plan (RANP) or the IMO SAR Plan, alerts from the SRR should 
normally no longer be routed via alerting posts like SAR Points of Contact (SPOCs), “associated” 
RCCs, intermediary aviation facilities, etc., unless warranted by some added SAR value or technically

Chapter 4 – Communications
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 4-7
4.5.9 RCC and RSC communications with mobile facilities may be handled directly, or via communications 
facilities. Communications with alerting posts and other SAR system elements, including other RCCs, 
should be reliable and, ideally, over dedicated lines which preserve message priority.
4.5.10 When practicable, routeing of distress alerts should include automatic retrieval of relevant associated

emergency information from communications registration databases.
4.5.11 ARCCs and MRCCs may install and use LESs or ship earth stations (SESs) to improve communications 
with units in distress, mobile facilities performing SAR functions, other RCCs, etc. Such installations 
may be unnecessary where reliable landline links exist between the RCC and its servicing LES; 
however, when Inmarsat’s SafetyNET is used (see appendix G) to relay distress alerts or other SAR

information, suitable arrangements will be needed to monitor the broadcasts. For maritime purposes, 
the Inmarsat-C SES is the most versatile; although it only handles data communications, it can be 
programmed for various functions, it can relay SAR alerts over SafetyNET, and most ships carry it.
4.5.12 ICAO’s Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network (AFTN) and Aeronautical Fixed Network 
(AFN) can be important for use by ARCCs, MRCCs and Cospas-Sarsat MCCs since they can handle

message priorities. They are among the most reliable links in some areas and comprise an extensive 
worldwide network with terminal connections at aviation facilities near most RCCs. ICAO has 
authorized use of these systems for maritime SAR where more suitable resources are unavailable.
4.5.13 Communication links to ARCCs can usually be satisfied by the nearest FIC or ACC. If the ARCC is not 
co-located with such facilities, circuits may be needed to connect with them.
 SAR data providers

SAR data providers
4.5.14 Ideally, all distress alerts should arrive with identification and position information. Automatic 
pre-formatted messages should meet formatting standards and the equipment generating the message 
should be registered with an appropriate SAR data provider (SDP). Complete and accurate registration 
databases available on a 24-hour basis can be critical for SAR operations and for identifying the calling

craft, to avoid having to dispatch a SAR facility when two-way communications cannot be established.
4.5.15 Registration of 406 MHz distress beacons and other distress-alerting equipment offers the chance to 
collect valuable emergency information which can later be made available to SAR personnel when 
needed. If the air or marine craft involved operates internationally, equipment registration data must be

readily available to RCCs on an international basis. For this to happen, either the data must somehow 
be provided along with the alert, RCCs must actually maintain the data, or RCCs must be informed on 
how to access the data. The data must be kept up to date by the users and responsible authorities.
4.5.16 States must make arrangements for registering distress alerting equipment and for this registration

information to be immediately available to SAR authorities. This means that register information 
must be available on a 24-hour basis and to all SAR authorities, including those of other States and 
organizations.
4.5.17 The 406 MHz distress beacons databases can be arranged for nationally or, after agreement, by another 
State. Where two or more States have agreed to establish one common database for 406 MHz distress

beacons, the country code for the country wherein the database is established should be programmed 
into bits 27 to 36 of the 406 MHz distress beacons so that SAR authorities requiring information will 
know where the emergency information can be obtained.
4.5.18 406 MHz distress beacons can be registered in the International 406 MHz Beacon Registration 
Database (IBRD), available online and free of charge. The IBRD provides access to beacon owners who

Chapter 4 – Communications
4-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
 All SAR services need to access beacon registration data held in the IBRD to efficiently process 
distress alerts. Administrations should designate a National IBRD Point of Contact to the Cospas-Sarsat 
Secretariat (contact details are contained in appendix D). Cospas-Sarsat will accept designations from 
the Cospas-Sarsat Representative or, for non-participating countries, the representative of an IMO

or ICAO Member State. Cospas-Sarsat will provide each National IBRD Point of Contact with user 
identifications and passwords to be used by:
 – national data providers for registration of beacons with their country code(s);
 – SAR services for IBRD queries; and
 – authorized shore-based service facilities and inspectors to verify proper coding and actual 
registration of the beacon.
 These IBRD user identifications and passwords should be distributed within each country under the

responsibility of the National IBRD Point of Contact.
 Further guidance on the IBRD registration process, including a letter template to request password 
access to the IBRD for SAR services, is provided on the Cospas-Sarsat website.*
4.5.19 The basic information which should be included in any database intended to be used to support SAR 
operations, if the equipment does not provide this information as part of the alert, is as follows:

– electronic identities (maritime mobile service identity (MMSI), call sign, number of ship earth 
stations using IMO-recognized mobile satellite service, EPIRB and ELT identification, etc.);
 – operator;
 – type of aircraft or vessel and/or maximum number of persons on board (less than 5, 5–25, or 
more than 25);
 – name, address and telephone number of a land-based emergency contact person;
 – alternative 24-hour emergency telephone number;

– aircraft registration marking (if not given above);† and
 – communications and navigation installations on board.†
4.5.20 Perhaps the most important of the above data is the emergency contacts. The value of all these data 
elements is independent of the type of equipment sending the alert. Communications equipment 
used aboard aircraft, vessels and other craft should be registered in readily accessible State databases.

Communications registration data should also be submitted to ITU for vessels engaged in international 
travel.
4.5.21 The authority maintaining the 406 MHz distress beacon database should facilitate the updating of 
emergency information in the 406 MHz distress beacon register and should contact the 406 MHz 
distress beacon licensee on at least a biennial basis to confirm that the database information is accurate.

4.5.22 The authority maintaining or using the database should ensure the information supplied for 406 MHz 
distress beacon registration is treated as restricted and ensure that it is used for SAR purposes only.
4.5.23 To achieve the best possible result in the coding and registration of 406 MHz distress beacons, 
including the timely retrieval of 406 MHz distress beacon emergency information by SAR authorities, 
the authority maintaining the database should:

Chapter 4 – Communications
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 4-9
 – cooperate closely with other States, manufacturers, owners, operators and organizations to help 
resolve any registration or information-retrieval problems that may arise;
 – ensure that procedures on how 406 MHz distress beacon database information can be obtained 
by SAR authorities is promulgated in the national aeronautical information publication (AIP);

– for a joint database, formalize cooperative arrangements between parties concerned for the 
maintenance of the database; and
 – arrange for appropriate procedures for the registration of a 406 MHz distress beacon when it is 
sold.
 GMDSS Master Plan
4.5.24 SOLAS regulation IV/5 requires that every State provides information to IMO about its shore-based 
communication facilities to support ships carrying Global Maritime Distress and Safety System

(GMDSS) communications equipment off its coasts. IMO collects and publishes this information in 
an indispensable reference for RCCs whose short name is the GMDSS Master Plan. SAR managers 
must ensure that the Master Plan has current information about its facilities, and that their RCCs, 
communications facilities, ships and training institutes have access to the Master Plan, which is 
available online in the IMO Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS).

4.5.25 The Master Plan shows for every State, in list format, the following services that are operational or 
planned:
 – VHF, MF and HF digital selective calling (DSC) installations;
 – IMO-recognized mobile satellite services, maritime safety information and broadcast services, 
NAVTEX, and HF narrow-band direct printing (NBDP) services;
 – EPIRB registration, MCC and LUT information; and
 – which RCCs are using SESs.
 Ship reports for SAR and vessel tracking

Ship reports for SAR and vessel tracking
4.5.26 Ship reporting systems are communications-intensive; yet, they are often important to successful rescues 
of persons from aircraft or marine craft in remote ocean areas. Therefore, SAR authorities should 
directly or indirectly recruit ships into such systems and help them to understand how to participate. 
Often aeronautical and maritime SAR personnel can, either directly or via their State’s maritime safety

authorities, recruit or require ships to participate. SAR authorities should, where practicable:
 – arrange for CRSs and LESs to relay ship messages to ship reporting systems for SAR free of charge 
to ships, and support any appropriate measures to enable such reports to be submitted with 
improved accuracy and ease; and
 – take advantage of ship reporting systems, where they exist, in arranging rescues by ships at sea.

This requires communications needed to retrieve reporting system data, and to contact ships 
from the system’s plot.
4.5.27 Several States operate ship reporting systems. Additional information on ship reporting systems 
is provided in the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination . Regardless of which system 
ships participate in, they should still be urged to participate in Amver, the only worldwide system

operated exclusively for SAR. Amver can be contacted (see appendix D) for user manuals for ships 
and information on how RCCs can obtain ship information for SAR. These services are free to all ships 
and RCCs.
4.5.28 As well as ship reporting systems, other vessel tracking systems and services are valuable for search 
and rescue. AIS, LRIT, VMS and vessel traffic services (VTS) are all valuable sources of vessel position

Chapter 4 – Communications
4-10 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
receive LRIT vessel position data for SAR, in accordance with applicable IMO guidance. The SAR 
service of the Contracting Government requests LRIT information for SAR only via the LRIT data 
centre serving the Contracting Government.
4.6 Supplemental capabilities
4.6.1 Instant-replay recording equipment to record aeronautical and maritime voice communications can

help document and verify information, and make it readily available for future reference and for other 
RCC or RSC personnel to hear. This is especially valuable for radio communications. When managers 
provide this equipment, typical practice includes the following:
 – all voice communications are recorded;
 – storage media are changed as necessary;
 – recordings are numbered, dated, and placed in locked storage under control and access of the 
RCC or RSC;

RCC or RSC;
 – recordings are kept for at least 30 days;
 – recordings are retained by the RCC when an investigation or judicial inquiry is anticipated or 
under way, with chain of custody maintained, and the storage media not recycled until released 
by a higher authority;
 – requests for recordings or transcripts should be directed in writing to the RCC; and
 – recordings or transcripts are only released to authorized personnel.

4.6.2 Equipment installed for telephone lines, such as answering machines, voicemail, call forwarding, 
automatic speed dialling and re-dialling, and caller identification, can provide recorded announcements 
and invite the caller to leave a message, save time and reduce errors. This improves chances that an 
incoming call will be successfully received, it saves time and reduces errors. These labour-saving

devices are a convenience to the caller if the staff cannot answer the call immediately due to other 
calls or duties but are no substitute for 24-hour watchstanding.
4.6.3 Caller identification for incoming calls is valuable for any emergency organization. It can save time, 
reduce errors, help identify hoax callers and enable the call to be re-established if it is inadvertently 
disconnected. This capability is technically feasible for long-distance calls, including cellular calls,

provided the appropriate switching is installed by the service providers and obstacles are removed for 
exchanging information between providers. Arrangements should be made so that unlisted numbers 
will not be withheld from emergency personnel. SAR authorities should encourage service providers 
to include these capabilities in their services.
4.6.4 Some States and service providers offer two- or three-digit numbers for emergency landline or cellular

telephone calls which are easy to remember and fast to dial. These arrangements enable a general 
public service answering point (PSAP) to connect the caller to the appropriate emergency response 
organization.
4.7 MEDICO communications
4.7.1 The ITU List of Radiodetermination and Special Service Stations  lists commercial and Government 
radio stations which provide free medical message service to ships. These incoming or outgoing

messages should be prefixed with “DH MEDICO”. Messages requesting medical advice are normally 
delivered only to hospitals or other facilities with which State authorities or the communications 
facility involved has made prior arrangements. Inmarsat provides service access codes (SACs) for 
medical advice and medical assistance. RCCs should be able to communicate 24 h a day with a 
designated telemedical assistance service (TMAS) to coordinate the provision of medical advice and

medical assistance and to arrange for medical evacuations from vessels at sea.
4.8 Radio call signs for aircraft involved in a search and rescue operation
4.8.1 A prefix call sign makes the task/function of a specific aircraft easier to be understood by other aircraft 
and participating units in the same area.
4.8.2 The prefix call sign can also give the aircraft priority in some situations.

4.8.3 The State authority responsible for air regulation shall ensure that use of prefix call sign will conform 
with other national air regulation practice.
4.8.4 During search and rescue missions and exercises it is recommended that the following prefix call signs 
be used before the ordinary radio call sign or as a specific mission call sign.
 “RESCUE”      for all airborne units involved in a rescue mission
 “AIR COORDINATOR”  for the aircraft coordinator (ACO)

“SAREX”      for all airborne units involved in international/national exercises
4.9 Social media
4.9.1  Social media are not part of the international distress alerting system and are not monitored as a primary 
means of distress notification. However, the public uses social media to create online communities 
to share information, ideas, personal messages and other content. This can raise a public expectation

System management
5.1 Understanding the SAR system
 Broad perspective
5.1.1 The historical process for achieving a global SAR system has been to develop national SAR systems 
and associate them with each other in a collection. One way to establish a national SAR system has 
been to assign responsibility for the system to one agency which was expected to depend on its own

resources to achieve success. A better and more cost-effective alternative may be to take a more 
global, regional or multi-agency approach.
 Global solution
5.1.2 Assisting any craft or person in distress serves national interests, is an established international practice 
based on traditional humanitarian obligations, and is founded in international law. A distress situation 
can occur anywhere at any time. An aircraft in-flight emergency may take place over long distances;

likewise, a person in distress at sea may drift a considerable distance. In both incidents, the emergency 
location may cross one or more SRRs.
5.1.3 The establishment of a global SAR system is intended to ensure that all persons in distress will be 
assisted regardless of their nationality or circumstances and wherever they may be found. Annex 12, 
Search and Rescue, to the International Civil Aviation Organization Convention and IMO’s International

Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue are the primary documents for establishing SAR service 
requirements.
5.1.4 State provisions for SAR services should be viewed as part of a global safety system. To this end, the 
States concerned with a particular land mass or ocean area should cooperate to use all available 
resources in assisting persons in distress.
 Regional approach
5.1.5 Neighbouring States can create a regional SAR system by means of bilateral or multilateral understandings

(e.g. plans and agreements) to cooperatively provide SAR services in a specific geographic area. A 
regional approach like this to providing SAR services has many advantages both to the beneficiaries of 
SAR services and to the States which provide those services. Duplication of effort and facilities can be 
avoided, more uniform services throughout the region can be provided, and proficient SAR services

are possible even near States with limited resources if a regional approach is taken to providing and 
improving SAR services. Some advantages are shown below.
(a) The number of RCCs can be reduced when a single RCC is supported by more than one State, 
enabling increased proficiency and economy overall and simplifying distribution of distress 
alerts.
(b) Communication databases and facilities can be consolidated where a single facility can serve

Chapter 5 – System management
5-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
5.1.6 Similar advantages are afforded by involving multiple agencies within a State in a cooperative SAR 
effort. While SAR management may become slightly more complex, the advantages gained in being 
able to do more with less make the approach worthwhile. 
 Assessing national and regional needs
5.1.7 Each State should assess its own responsibilities and requirements and then evaluate its abilities as

a SAR service provider for both national and regional needs. Whether establishing a SAR system or 
conducting a periodic review of an established one, assessments provide a factual basis on which to 
make improvements. Such assessments also help to gain continued support for SAR system funding, to 
obtain assistance from other agencies, or to justify procurement of additional resources. Appendix H

contains a national self-assessment questionnaire which may be used to evaluate international and 
national SAR systems aligned to ICAO and IMO SAR obligations, to identify areas for improvement, 
and to assist SAR managers in assessing needs. The questionnaire may be used for conducting a 
periodic review of an established SAR system or as a support tool to guide the establishment of a 
SAR system.
5.2 Planning processes

SAR system.
5.2 Planning processes
5.2.1 There are specific planning processes appropriate for each level of the SAR system. Operational 
levels must develop plans of operation, search plans, rescue plans, etc. The SAR manager should 
develop what might be called “programme plans.” Plans developed by international or interagency 
SAR coordinating committees (SCCs) tend to be strategic, focused on areas of interest their members

share in common, and used for implementation of higher-level conventions, legislation and plans 
which apply to multiple members.
 Planning activities
5.2.2 SAR management planning processes involve:
 – assessing emerging technologies and other environmental changes and opportunities;
 – appraising the system, including use of SAR statistics to identify recurring causes of distress 
incidents;
 – analysing and responding to the findings and recommendations of accident investigations;

– promoting legislation, rules, treaties, or agreements to improve safety;
 – sharing information among programmes and organizations; and
 – participating in SCCs and international and interagency SAR meetings.
5.2.3 SAR managers should periodically assess their programme and update their long-range plans. An 
annual review is suggested.
 Using goals to improve the SAR system
5.2.4 Establishing well-defined and realistic goals is an excellent way to ensure continuous improvement

in the SAR system. Goals should clearly promote public well-being by seeking to minimize injury, 
death and property damage related to air, sea and land transportation. Goals also should promote 
cooperation among Government agencies, ensuring efficient use of public resources. Such goals are 
often addressed by national legislation that establishes a SAR system.
5.2.5 Useful goals are consistent with SAR mission and purpose; they are associated with specific objectives,

Chapter 5 – System management
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 5-3
(c) Improve safety so that the number of distress events is reduced. Achieving this goal may require 
close cooperation with other aeronautical and maritime authorities, since they, and not the SAR 
managers, may be responsible for the necessary safety programmes.
(d) Improve cooperation between aeronautical and maritime SAR authorities, which is important 
because:
 – aircraft may need assistance over either land or water;

– sharing SAR resources is usually the most efficient way to maximize system success;
 – coordination of SAR operations and sharing of operational information can be simplified 
and expedited;
 – accountability for SAR system personnel is increased; and
 – routeing of distress alerts to appropriate RCCs is expedited by harmonized communications 
plans and SAR regions.
 Developing objectives to support SAR goals

Developing objectives to support SAR goals
5.2.6 Typically, each goal will have a few associated objectives. In turn, each objective will have action 
items, with due dates and responsible persons assigned.
5.2.7 Objectives established in support of SAR goals are typically stated in terms of specified response time, 
rescuing a percentage of persons at risk of death, or property at risk of destruction. These objectives

are meaningful and relatively easy to quantify. Other objectives, such as injuries and property damage 
prevented or anxiety relieved, can be used though they are more difficult to measure. Also, persons 
and property are not always in imminent danger when rescue facilities arrive on scene. However, 
were it not for the SAR system’s rapid response, their situation may well have deteriorated. In such

incidents, even though SAR system presence probably prevented an eventual loss of life or property, 
the SAR system is credited with “assistance” only. 
5.2.8 The following are sample objectives for which results can be measured for a particular geographic 
region to develop and comply with response time criteria:
 – to save [X]% of individuals in distress;
 – to save [X]% of property in danger of destruction.
 Long-range planning

Long-range planning
5.2.9 SAR managers should develop long-range (typically five-year) plans for achievements in their 
respective areas of responsibility. These plans will document goals, objectives and intended actions. 
All these goals should relate directly or indirectly to SAR operational needs. They also serve as a tool 
for implementing higher-level directives, legislation, SCC plans, and other similar documents.

5.2.10 The benefits of developing SAR plans which foster ongoing improvements in SAR capabilities go 
well beyond the potential lives saved. For example, at the national level, goals often relate to saving 
property as well as lives, since saving property is often a natural by-product of life-saving efforts. 
This contributes to favourable cost–benefit justifications for further investment in SAR. The potential

economic value of SAR’s contribution to safe transportation can be important to States which depend 
on international business or tourist travel for a sound economy. Looked at another way, the adverse 
international publicity which might result from loss of lives due to poor handling of a major distress 
situation could have long-term economic consequences.
 SAR plans
5.2.11 SAR plans describe how SAR services will be provided, organized and supported. SCs oversee and

Chapter 5 – System management
5-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
5.2.12 A national SAR plan is a single document that pertains to the SRRs, RCCs, and RSCs and SAR-related 
functions for which one State is responsible. Principles of operational coordination must be covered 
in this plan, which serves as a basis for more detailed provisions in subordinate State documents such 
as a SAR manual or plans of operation. Other types of SAR cooperation, such as mutual visits and

training, also may be addressed. The national SAR plan may include a:
 – description of the SRR, including the limits for any SRSs created to make the organization more 
efficient;
 – description of the available facilities, personnel, and equipment;
 – discussion of the SAR personnel training programme, qualification standards, and certification 
procedures;
 – discussion of the roles and responsibilities of all agencies which will provide or support SAR 
services;

services;
 – copy or summary of all agreements with authorities providing facilities and services not under 
the direct control of the SAR managers; and
 – copy or summary of all agreements regarding mutual assistance with neighbouring RCCs.
5.2.13 A SAR plan may be supported by legislation or regulations if necessary, or may be a self-supporting 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) between appropriate agencies. Ratification of an MOU at the

Ministry level recognizes the importance of SAR, while allowing for an easier revision process than 
higher-level agreements would allow.
5.2.14 A primary duty of SAR authorities is cooperation with neighbouring States. A regional SAR plan is 
a way to provide a framework to guide national SAR authorities towards attaining this cooperation. 
Once a regional SAR plan is developed, high-level commitment between States can be reached by

means of written agreement or through a multilateral MOU. A multilateral arrangement provides for 
consistent, harmonious and expedient response to distress incidents. Appendix I contains guidance 
and a sample SAR agreement.
5.2.15 Appendix K contains sample text to describe arrangements for the division of responsibilities between 
the Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) and the Air Traffic Services (ATS) provider as component

organizations contributing to the national emergency response system for aircraft.
5.2.16 Sometimes, Ministers of Transport sign regional SAR plans since often both civil aviation and maritime 
safety programmes are under their purview. They are usually in the best position to designate and 
support SCs, who may include the Directors of Civil Aviation, Merchant Marine Safety or other officials

with similar duties. The Ministers of Transport are often in the best position to promote coordination 
and harmonization of maritime and aeronautical SAR.
5.2.17 Once a regional SAR plan is in effect, signatories should see that appropriate subordinate plans (and 
legislation or regulations needed to implement them) are developed to ensure cooperation.
 Hierarchy of SAR documents
5.2.18 There are different levels and types of SAR documents as illustrated in figure 5-1. Global SAR plans

include IMO’s SAR Plan and ICAO’s Regional Air Navigation Plans (RANPs). These global plans are a 
basis for implementing national and regional (bilateral or multilateral) plans, manuals, agreements and 
related SAR documents. The IMO Global SAR Plan and applicable ICAO RANP would be followed 
by a regional SAR plan where a regional SAR system exists. Next would be the national SAR plan, and 
so forth down to the RCC and local levels.

so forth down to the RCC and local levels.
5.2.19 SAR manuals provide guidance on implementing the plans. International SAR manuals may be 
followed by regional or national manuals, and then by plans of operation for the RCCs and RSCs. 
Some plans have an administrative character while others have an operational focus.

5.3 Organization
 Managing resources to meet requirements
5.3.1 There are two basic types of management for the SAR system: administration and operations. 
Administration includes planning, organizing, staffing, funding and assessing the SAR system.

Operations management includes routine and emergency activities supporting SAR response 
operations. From an overall management perspective, a SAR system consists of:
 – an area within which SAR services are to be provided; and
 – a process to transform operational requirements and national commitments into the provision 
of SAR services.
 Establishment of RCCs and RSCs
5.3.2 Each SRR must have an RCC. When a State assumes responsibility for an SRR, it commits to establish

and staff a fully capable RCC. If necessary, RSCs may be established under an RCC to assist in 
providing services within an SRR. An RSC would be responsible for SAR services within its SRS.
5.3.3 SAR managers have the overall responsibility for establishing, organizing, staffing, equipping and 
controlling the SAR system. The managers also provide or arrange for legal and funding support, 
establish RCCs and RSCs, provide or arrange for use of SAR facilities, coordinate non-operational

activities such as SAR training and develop SAR policies and procedures. The manager’s role should 
be assigned to a person or an appropriate agency. Managers should ensure compliance with the SAR 
provisions of IMO and ICAO conventions to which their State is a party. This is an administrative 
position and can be full- or part-time. SAR managers normally:
 – develop, coordinate, administer, review and evaluate plans, policies, procedures, standards and

providing services within an SRR. An RSC would be responsible for SAR services within its SRS.

5.3.3 SAR managers have the overall responsibility for establishing, organizing, staffing, equipping and

provisions of IMO and ICAO conventions to which their State is a party. This is an administrative 
position and can be full- or part-time. SAR managers normally:
 – develop, coordinate, administer, review and evaluate plans, policies, procedures, standards and 
training requirements for SAR cooperation and coordination;
 – establish and support RCC and RSC facilities;
 – support, assist and possibly chair the SCC;
 – promote SAR system effectiveness and commitment to SAR objectives;

Chapter 5 – System management
5-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
 – coordinate plans and procedures with other organizational managers that support, participate in, 
or provide resources for SAR operations;
 – maintain SAR plans, manuals and other SAR directives;
 – establish and maintain liaison with appropriate SAR contacts, nationally, regionally and 
internationally;
 – develop the SAR budget and administer appropriated funds;
 – maintain SAR data, a SAR library and SAR case files;

– compile SAR statistics and conduct and review SAR case studies;
 – develop SAR agreements and improved international SAR capabilities and procedures;
 – promote efficient and effective use of all available SAR resources;
 – improve SAR communications;
 – provide information to facility managers for operational performance standards and resource 
acquisition, geographic distribution and readiness status;

– encourage joint training and exercises leading to development of improved SAR procedures and 
technology;
 – initiate, review, and evaluate SAR research and development efforts;
 – participate in SAR seminars and workshops;
 – promote safety programmes to decrease distress incidents;
 – develop contingency plans for SAR resources to respond to natural and man-made disasters;
 – supervise SAR programme training;
 – provide support services such as emergency fuelling or medical assistance;

– develop procedures to provide critical incident stress counselling to SAR personnel; and
 – promote visits between SAR programme personnel and among RCC and RSC personnel and 
others with special expertise related to SAR or SAR support.
5.3.4 Some SAR authorities have created a regional or national level SCC. This group brings together and 
helps to coordinate the activities of all agencies which are concerned with or can assist with SAR.

The SCC, when it exists, usually is the approving authority for the policies and procedures that are 
incorporated into the SAR plan. The SCC represents the interests of both SAR service providers and 
probable beneficiaries in the development of SAR policies, plans, and agreements.
5.3.5 RCCs and their subordinate RSCs are the primary operational elements in the SAR organization. 
Chapter 2 discusses their roles and responsibilities.

5.3.6 SAR operations are normally carried out under the direction and supervision of an SMC, who is 
usually the supervisor of the RCC or RSC watch team. In multiple-incident situations this officer could 
be SMC for all incidents, or, for some of those incidents, the SMC role could be delegated to another 
suitably qualified member of the watch team. The SMC should in all cases be supported by RCC 
watch team members to undertake functions in the coordinating process such as communications,

plotting, logging and search planning. For complex cases or those of long duration, the assisting team 
must be replaced at regular intervals as well as the SMC. The SMC must be able to competently 
gather information about emergencies, transform emergency incident information into accurate and 
workable plans and dispatch and coordinate the facilities which will carry out the SAR missions.

Chapter 5 – System management
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 5-7
5.3.8 SRUs are the facilities which respond to the distress situation and which carry the personnel who 
perform the actual SAR operations. Chapter 2 discusses SRU requirements and considerations.
5.3.9 An alerting post is a facility involved in receiving information about an apparent distress situation and 
relaying it to an RCC or RSC. See chapter 4.
 Maximizing system effectiveness and benefits

Maximizing system effectiveness and benefits
5.3.10 Effective SAR services consist of more than just the response to distressed persons. For the SAR system 
to realize maximum effectiveness, certain activities must take place.
(a) A high degree of readiness must be maintained. Distress alerts may come at any time and the 
system must always be ready to receive and respond to them. Individuals, items of equipment,

communications links, etc., must be examined and operated frequently to ensure they will 
function correctly when an emergency arises. These inspections are as important to the safety 
of SAR personnel as they are to the persons or craft being assisted.
(b) Periodic training and exercises must be conducted with the various SAR system components in 
order to maintain proficiency and safety. Training, and especially exercises, allow early detection

and correction of procedural and equipment problems before an emergency arises. Training and 
exercises are addressed in chapter 3.
(c) “Preventive SAR” is important. All SAR systems should include activities aimed at the prevention 
and mitigation of SAR incidents. Patrols, supervision of large events such as regattas, air shows, 
safety inspections and public awareness campaigns are some of the ways to help prevent SAR

incidents or mitigate the effects of those that do occur. Volunteer organizations can often assist 
in these activities at little or no cost to the SAR authorities.
(d) The focus of all activities other than actual SAR operations should be on the continuous 
improvement of the SAR system. Chapter 6 describes the necessary factors and recommends 
some techniques for creating an organizational environment that fosters continuous improvement.

5.3.11 Below are sample initiatives which States may consider for improving safety and SAR effectiveness; 
managers must determine what is appropriate to individual circumstances.
(a) Use legislation to designate specific agencies with organizing and coordinating SAR services.
(b) Avoid policies which pre-empt the judgement of SAR professionals on whether it is safe and 
appropriate to render assistance in a particular situation.

(c) Provide urgent life-saving measures without regard to the nationality or circumstances of those 
needing assistance.
(d) Confirm that those assigned to SAR operations have maturity and competency appropriate to 
their particular duties.
(e) Use internationally recognized procedures, types of facilities and equipment.
(f) Ensure that RCC and RSC personnel are prepared to properly receive, collect, assess, use,

preserve and provide information related to a distress situation or to SAR coordination.
(g) Ensure that operational personnel are trained to work together continuously as a team, to 
recognize and avoid undue risks and to prevent accidents, damage, injury, death, or worsening 
of the situation of those in distress.
(h) Recognize that rescue operations are often carried out under circumstances of extreme stress,

Chapter 5 – System management
5-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
(i) Keep complete and accurate logs of SAR operations, and include detailed information of any 
problems which develop to assist in carrying out a proper investigation and reporting of an 
incident and finding ways to apply lessons learned to prevent future recurrences.
(j) Use directives, policies, regulations, plans, manuals, etc., to document SAR guidance or 
requirements.

requirements.
(k) Do not consider assumption of one effort by the SAR system (e.g. life-saving) to automatically 
require another (e.g. salvage).
(l) Understand that it is not always possible for those on scene or others involved to know the 
best course of action; e.g. pulling a grounded boat free may result in its sinking, and leaving it 
grounded may result in its destruction by pounding on rocks, so there may be damage regardless 
of whether SAR personnel attempt to save the property.

5.3.12 The following provisions may help to produce a stronger and more flexible SAR system:
 – ensure that SAR is recognized in legislation as an official function which will be supported by the 
State, which will likely facilitate any SAR manager efforts to obtain support;
 – require that SAR plans and arrangements provide, as practicable, for use of all available resources; 
and
 – adopt measures which promote safe design, construction, maintenance, and operation of aircraft,

ships and other marine craft.
5.3.13 Variations of the terms “saving” and “salving” are commonly used internationally regarding removal 
of property from risk. Some factors to consider in developing policies on saving property include:
 – cost and risks involved in saving property;
 – benefits and methods of estimating the value of saved property;
 – whether abandoning property may introduce other problems, such as pollution or hazards to 
navigation;

navigation;
 – whether proper facilities, equipment and skill seem to be available to conduct particular salvage 
operations;
 – need to exercise reasonable care for the sake of safety and minimizing property damage;
 – possible need for available SRUs to handle higher priority duties at the time; and
 – advice of SAR personnel on scene who are usually in the best position to assess the situation.
5.3.14 Accommodating the saving of property:

5.3.14 Accommodating the saving of property:
 – is often a natural extension of life-saving efforts;
 – may be a means of life-saving, e.g. saving a vessel may be the best means of saving the lives 
aboard the vessel;
 – may help to justify SAR resources due to the value of the property saved; and
 – will take advantage of SAR facility capabilities when other means of saving property may be 
unavailable or too expensive.
5.3.15 Dealing with emergency situations other than SAR:

Chapter 8 of the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination, discusses the use of SAR services 
to respond to emergencies that may not correspond to traditional aeronautical or maritime search 
and rescue operations. SAR personnel and resources may be expected or requested to assist in such 
situations and may need to do so in cooperation with other emergency response authorities.
5.4 Resources
 Obtaining resources

5.4 Resources
 Obtaining resources
5.4.1 The primary resources of a SAR organization are the operational facilities made available to it by 
various authorities. While these facilities remain administratively under their respective authorities, 
their operations for SAR are coordinated and guided by the SMC.
5.4.2 SAR managers must provide or arrange for the use of the primary SAR facilities. Although the SCs

have overall responsibility and the RCC has operational responsibility to coordinate SAR operations, 
they may have limited facilities directly under their control. They usually depend on other agencies 
and organizations to provide SAR response facilities. The military services, due to their resources and 
training, often are a primary source of response assets. MOUs should be arranged at both the SC and

RCC levels to provide for the efficient use of military resources when needed. These arrangements 
should be part of a SAR plan. An SCC often can provide a forum for resolving such issues.
5.4.3 In establishing a SAR service, States should use existing facilities to the fullest extent possible. 
A successful SAR organization can be created without having designated, full-time SAR units. Facilities 
used for operations not connected with SAR often may be made more useful for SAR service by

adapting them, e.g. instructing volunteers and auxiliary organizations in first aid and radiotelephony 
procedures; installing radiotelephone equipment on fishing vessels, yachts and other small craft; and 
using isolated stations as alerting posts. By providing training and equipment, and integrating all 
facilities, an efficient SAR service can be set up with little or no need for designated SAR units.

5.4.4 Different geographic areas pose varying problems for SAR operations because of climates, topography 
or physical characteristics. Such factors will influence which facilities, equipment and personnel are 
required and available for SAR services. Appendix C lists potential sources from which assistance may 
be obtained; common sources include:
 – State, provincial, and local Government departments;
 – fire and police departments, military, coastguard, lifeboat and other auxiliary services;

– communications facilities;
 – aircraft operating agencies;
 – commercial ships of all sizes and types;
 – fishing vessels, yachts and small craft;
 – ship reporting systems and vessel tracking systems;
 – auxiliaries (privately owned craft organized for SAR);
 – volunteer SAR organizations;
 – sports clubs and similar organizations; and
 – commercial enterprises.
5.4.5 In some circumstances there may be a need for immediate response to large numbers of persons

in distress such that the capabilities normally available to the SAR authorities are inadequate. These 
are known as mass rescue operations: see chapter 6. SAR managers should plan to acquire the extra 
resources necessary for such operations by:
 – agreeing to share SAR facilities regionally and/or internationally;
 – identifying additional SAR facilities locally, including shipping in the area; and
 – identifying ways of providing support to persons in distress until they can be rescued.

using isolated stations as alerting posts. By providing training and equipment, and integrating all 
facilities, an efficient SAR service can be set up with little or no need for designated SAR units.

5.4.4 Different geographic areas pose varying problems for SAR operations because of climates, topography 
or physical characteristics. Such factors will influence which facilities, equipment and personnel are 
required and available for SAR services. Appendix C lists potential sources from which assistance may 
be obtained; common sources include:
 – State, provincial, and local Government departments;
 – fire and police departments, military, coastguard, lifeboat and other auxiliary services;

– communications facilities;
 – aircraft operating agencies;
 – commercial ships of all sizes and types;
 – fishing vessels, yachts and small craft;
 – ship reporting systems and vessel tracking systems;
 – auxiliaries (privately owned craft organized for SAR);
 – volunteer SAR organizations;
 – sports clubs and similar organizations; and
 – commercial enterprises.
5.4.5 In some circumstances there may be a need for immediate response to large numbers of persons

in distress such that the capabilities normally available to the SAR authorities are inadequate. These 
are known as mass rescue operations: see chapter 6. SAR managers should plan to acquire the extra 
resources necessary for such operations by:
 – agreeing to share SAR facilities regionally and/or internationally;
 – identifying additional SAR facilities locally, including shipping in the area; and
 – identifying ways of providing support to persons in distress until they can be rescued.

 Obtaining funds
5.4.6 The SAR system must have funding support commensurate with national goals. Support is often 
improved when the manager is able to educate others about the importance of the SAR system and 
keep them informed of significant ongoing activities. Funding can be minimized by making use of all 
available resources, but there may be specific SAR needs, such as training, specialized equipment,

and others, which require funding. The national SAR plan and the SCC can support budget issues.
5.4.7 Sound funding decisions arise out of accurate assessments made of the SAR system. To measure the 
performance or effectiveness of a SAR system usually requires collecting information or statistics and 
establishing agreed-upon goals. All pertinent information should be collected, including where the

system failed to perform as it should have; failures and successes provide valuable information in 
assessing effectiveness and determining means to improve.
5.4.8 On an international basis, custom and practice hold that the State providing aeronautical and maritime 
SAR services fund those services, even if the assistance is provided at the request of another entity, 
e.g. an RCC of another State. Requests for reimbursement are not normally made, therefore, to the

State requesting or receiving the services.
5.4.9 With respect to SAR services rendered domestically, it is normally impractical to charge those assisted, 
since they would be unable to afford the full cost in most cases. However, some authorities have 
initiated advance fees charged to certain groups, or to participants in certain dangerous activities, to 
help offset the general costs of providing SAR services needed by those groups or for those activities.

It is important to consider that a policy of charging for SAR services after they are rendered may 
prompt those in danger to delay calling for assistance until it is either too late to save them, or until 
the resulting level of SAR effort needed is much greater. Deciding in each case whether to charge for 
a response will often also need to be subjective.

5.4.11 Staffing consists of filling positions in the SAR organization by identifying work requirements, and then 
recruiting, selecting, placing, evaluating, promoting, compensating and training needed personnel. 
Staffing must be closely linked with organizing roles and positions.
5.4.12 The objective of staffing is to fill organizational roles with qualified persons. Clear organizational

roles and requirements and sound managerial appraisal and training techniques help to ensure quality 
performance.
5.4.13 Staffing has several key aspects.
(a) Position definition. The more precisely the functions and tasks of a position are identified, the 
better the requirements of the position can be defined.
(b) Skill definition. Skills and personal characteristics needed by the person are defined.

(c) Matching qualifications. The candidate’s abilities are compared to the position requirements.
(d) Performance evaluation. When position objectives are clear, staff performance can be better 
assessed.
(e) Training, qualification, and certification . Qualification is achieving skills. Certification is 
acknowledgement of overall competence.
(f) Continuing development.
  The first four of these aspects are discussed in this chapter; the last two are discussed in chapters 3 
and 6.

Chapter 5 – System management
5-12 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
5.4.14 A range of general skills helps SAR personnel to be more effective.
(a) Particularly at upper organizational levels, managers should be able to see a problem and design a 
workable solution. If they merely see the problem and become “problem watchers”, they will fail.
(b) The ability to see the “big picture”, to recognize significant elements in a situation, and to

understand the relationships among elements, is valuable at all levels, with the possible exception 
of the task-focused operational level.
(c) The ability to work with people, to engage in cooperative effort, to foster teamwork, and to 
create an environment in which people feel secure and free to express their opinions is needed 
throughout the SAR organization.
(d) Proficiency in activities involving methods, processes, and procedures, usually working with

support equipment, is especially useful for SAR facility operators, searchers and rescuers.
5.4.15 Desired personal characteristics for SAR personnel include:
(a) Persistence. The SAR person exhibits a dedication to find the victim. Patience, tenacity and 
perseverance are common in SAR team members.
(b) Dedication to rescue. SAR personnel must often walk a fine line between personal safety and 
endangerment during a rescue. In the rescuer’s mind, the safety of the victim may rise above

personal safety.
(c) Ability to communicate with empathy. Reports, letters, speeches, and discussions about SAR 
demand clarity and accuracy, but they also require the ability to understand the feelings of other 
people and to deal with emotional aspects of communications. 
(d) Integrity and honesty. SAR members should be morally sound and worthy of trust. Integrity in 
SAR requires being honest about search parameters and results, keeping superiors informed,

adhering to the full truth at all times.
(e) Experience. Past exposure to a wide range of SAR situations is valuable. Prior experience is 
a predictor of future performance. Although organizations often promote their operationally 
experienced personnel into management or administrative positions, caution must be exercised 
to ensure that the required expertise remains available at the operational level to train others.

5.4.16 After SAR positions are identified, candidates who best meet a position’s specific requirements should 
be selected to fill them as practicable.
5.4.17 Systems of appraising personnel performance against verifiable pre-selected goals have great value.
5.5 Leadership and operations
5.5.1 The ultimate goal of a safety system is to foster safety. As the number of unsafe events declines, so 
does the perceived need for the safety system. Without someone to defend the safety system, it could

eventually lose support because of its own success. In developing a SAR system, such a person can 
be essential for providing focus on the problem and the need for cooperation.
5.5.2 SAR system success occurs each time a person is removed from a distress situation. The operational 
goal of the system is to match the rescuer with the person(s) in distress and move that person to a 
position of safety. All the elements and components of the system must work together to that end.

Chapter 5 – System management

(b) Will national SAR services include saving property, and if so, under what conditions?
(c) Will non-Administration resources used for SAR be supported by the State, train and exercise 
with State-owned resources and operate under the same authority and policies as State facilities?
(d) To what degree will the SAR organization ensure adequate coverage and readiness for its 
geographic areas of responsibility?

geographic areas of responsibility?
(e) How will geographic areas of responsibility be delineated?
(f) Will civil SAR normally be given priority over other missions of multi-mission facilities, and, if so, 
how will that be ensured?
(g) How will physical risk be held to reasonable levels for those assisting and those being assisted, 
and who will determine when a particular aspect of an operation would involve undue risk?
 Data requirements

Data requirements
5.6.2 Statistical analysis of programme data is important for documenting the need for a well-functioning 
and efficient SAR system. Knowing the numbers of lives saved, people assisted and amount of property 
loss prevented can be very useful when competing for limited resources. SAR programme statistics 
tend to underestimate the total national SAR effort expended because the SAR system is typically not 
made aware of all distress incidents or assistance provided.

5.6.3 SAR data tracking should include at least the total number, or amounts, of:
 – incidents;
 – responses;
 – sorties;
 – lives saved;
 – lives lost;
 – persons otherwise assisted;
 – value of property lost;
 – value of property saved/assisted;
 – property loss prevented; and
 – time expended on sorties.
5.6.4 This data should also reference the types of participating SAR facilities, types of units assisted and

geographic distribution of SAR cases. Other useful data includes the type of alerting means, method 
of locating the distressed person or property, nature and cause of the incident, distance offshore, size 
of units assisted and assistance rendered. To aid in analysis, this data should be coded and entered 
into a computer database for ease of information management and use when practicable.

5.6.5 The types of data collected, the collection methodology, and methods of calculating SAR costs must 
remain the same from year to year in order to yield credible results. Include adjustment for inflation (a 
similar adjustment to the effectiveness measures is not required).
 System effectiveness and efficiency
5.6.6 For States which use the SAR system to minimize loss of both life and property, system effectiveness

Chapter 5 – System management
5-14 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
 Programme effectiveness for preventing loss of property  = EFF(P) =   PLP _______ PLP + PL  
 where:   LS  = Lives Saved
     LLA  = Lives Lost After Notification
     PLP  =  value of Property Loss Prevented (calculated estimated amount of property loss 
that would have occurred had the SAR system not rendered assistance).
     PL  = value of Property Lost

PL  = value of Property Lost
5.6.8 In both measures, the denominator represents the total lives or property available to be saved. The 
numerator represents the lives or property actually saved. The resultant ratios measure the proportion 
of lives or property actually saved versus the total available to be saved.
5.6.9 Lives lost before SAR system notification were not saveable; therefore, they are excluded from the

life-saving effectiveness measure. Lives lost after notification reflect the potential number of additional 
lives that may have been saved. Studies suggest that about one third of the deaths that occur after 
SAR system notification happen soon thereafter before help can arrive, or due to such serious injury 
or sickness that saving life was not possible. The remaining lives lost may be attributed to a less than 
optimal SAR system.

optimal SAR system.
5.6.10 Property lost after notification is a more subjective measure. For lack of a better value to apply to the 
property lost equation, subtract the property’s value after loss from its value before SAR notification, 
the remainder being the loss.
5.6.11 Measures of system effectiveness must be sensitive to changes in the SAR system. Improved response 
time of rescue units, improvements in alerting and determining datum and improved search sensors

and search techniques are some enhancements that should increase effectiveness. Conversely, 
degradation of these factors will lead to lower levels of effectiveness.
5.6.12 Effectiveness measures are also influenced by factors external to the SAR system. For example, aviation 
or boating safety initiatives, or legislation to reduce drinking of alcoholic beverages, should reduce the 
number of people and property in need of saving. Some variability in these measures is beyond SAR

system control. A single incident resulting in either a large number of lives saved or lost, or a major 
natural disaster, could produce a significant change for a particular year. However, this data will help 
to determine viable long-term SAR system effectiveness trends.
5.6.13 Cost-benefit ratios can be determined and used to measure SAR system efficiency; however, the 
need to determine the general value to assume for a human life may be difficult. Sometimes other

Government services can be identified which have already dealt with the human life value issue, 
because cost–benefit analyses of safety programmes are typically the concerns of several agencies of 
each State. Another approach relates the effectiveness of saving lives to the total direct SAR costs for 
a given year, as shown below.
 Programme effectiveness =   EFF(L) × 100,000  ____________________   direct SAR programme costs

An arbitrary scaling factor (100,000 in this example) is used to eliminate excessively small numbers. 
The effectiveness measure for saving lives was selected in preference to the measure for saving 
property simply because saving lives is the primary goal of the SAR system.
5.6.14 SAR data should be reliable even though some of the data elements such as lives saved, persons 
otherwise assisted, and value of property assisted are subjective. SAR data collection and subsequent

analyses are not discredited by its inability to collect data related to incidents not reported, or 
responded to, by the SAR system.
5.7 Dealing with the media
5.7.1 The management of media affairs is an important element in SAR operations and should be an integral 
part of the SAR system. It should thus receive appropriate consideration and planning. If the media do 
not obtain information from the primary source they will seek it elsewhere. Incorrect or misleading

Chapter 5 – System management
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 5-15
information may then emerge which will benefit no-one and may lead to undue concern amongst 
next of kin.
5.7. 2 As search and rescue operations often take place in public, it is important that the information that 
emerges is correct. The SAR service thus has a responsibility to ensure that an accurate picture is 
reported. As the primary source, the SAR service should be proactive in communicating facts to the

Improving services
6.1 Managing for success
 The SAR manager’s mission
6.1.1 The mission of SAR is to find persons in distress, assist them, and deliver them to a place of safety. 
A key to building successful SAR services is the SAR manager, whose mission is to carry out duties that 
result in better SAR operations, i.e. improved services to persons in distress.

6.1.2 This chapter provides guidance and principles to help the SAR manager perform more effectively. The 
SAR manager should also seek to instil these principles, as applicable, to operational levels of the SAR 
organization.
6.1.3 No SAR system, domestic or otherwise, is built overnight. Neither is there, nor will there ever be, 
sufficient SAR resources to ensure successful response to every distress incident. Therefore, the manager

must first identify available resources, either under the manager’s direct control or available through 
cooperative arrangements, and ensure that these resources are being used to their full potential to 
support or carry out SAR operations. Then, processes that enable continuous improvement in the use, 
capabilities, qualities and quantities of these resources should be employed. A manager always begins

with available resources and then works with others who can help plan and implement improvements.
 Focus on quality
6.1.4 Common reasons that SAR managers fail are that they are doing the wrong things, doing the right things 
the wrong way, or attempting to do everything alone; this chapter may help prevent these mistakes.
6.1.5 Focus on improving the quality of SAR services simultaneously improves results and reduces costs,

goals important to any Administration regardless of the amount of resources at its disposal. SAR 
organizations which focus on quality tend to:
 – do more and make fewer mistakes;
 – enjoy a sound reputation; and
 – attract resources needed for growth and better performance.
6.1.6 SAR organizations that do not focus on quality are susceptible to errors that could lead to:
 – reduction in lives saved;
 – poor or late operational decisions;
 – confusion, accidents, and equipment failures; and

Chapter 6 – Improving services
6-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
(b) Important matters more than urgent matters. A SAR manager must first manage time. Planning, 
coordinating, directing, evaluating, and other basic management functions which bring lasting 
improvements require dedicated time which must be set aside, protected and used for those 
purposes.
(c) Satisfaction of the needs of others. The manager depends on people throughout and outside the

SAR organization to accomplish the SAR mission. All these people, in turn, depend upon the 
SAR manager to provide what they need; the manager should involve them in identifying these 
needs. Such needs include information, training, policies and funding. The successful manager will 
identify these people and strive to see that what they need to support the SAR system is provided.
(d) A philosophy of continuous improvement.
6.2 Reducing system problems

6.2 Reducing system problems
6.2.1 A SAR manager must identify and resolve problems that hamper improvements in SAR services. The 
thoughts of others familiar with the situation should be sought and considered in identifying and 
prioritizing SAR system problems, selecting the next problem to solve and finding and dealing with 
the cause(s) of that problem. The following sections discuss general problem-solving within the SAR 
system.
 Finding the cause

system.
 Finding the cause
6.2.2 One method used to find the source of a problem is to ask why that problem exists. Each time 
the question “why?” is answered, again ask “why?” about the answer, until that process leads to 
the true source of the problem. For example, if the problem is too many accidents aboard boats 
used for SAR, the initial causes may appear to be inadequately trained personnel and inadequately

maintained equipment. Why do the training and maintenance problems exist? Perhaps the personnel 
were assigned to jobs before the training they needed was scheduled and the provided training did 
not cover all the needed skills. Perhaps the supervision and tools needed for adequate equipment 
maintenance were not available. One or two more uses of the question “why?” in this process will 
soon lead to the root causes.
 Creating the solution

Creating the solution
6.2.3 Once a SAR problem and its causes have been analysed, reasonable solutions must be developed. In 
considering solutions, it helps to keep in mind general factors which, in dealing with problems in the 
past, have:
 – contributed to solutions; and
 – held back progress, efficiency, and effectiveness.
6.2.4 Possibly, the favourable factors can be employed again, and a plan can be developed, if necessary,

for dealing with the unfavourable ones. For example, if involvement of all affected persons in the 
development of a solution contributed to successful implementation in the past, a similar approach 
might be considered for the new problem; or if poorly informed top management disapproved use of 
a previous plan, more care in briefing such persons on the problem, solutions and the benefits of the 
preferred solutions could be wise this time.
 Monitoring results

Monitoring results
6.2.5 Once a plan is developed to solve a SAR system problem, the improved plan or process is implemented, 
and the results are monitored. The plan will be revised and tried again as many times as is necessary. 
Once it works well, it can be institutionalized by a new or better policy, standard, equipment design, 
coordination procedure, training requirement, or other solution.

6.2.6 SAR problems are reduced, and SAR service effectiveness is optimized, by ensuring that only relevant 
and proper things are being done and that these things are done in the proper way.
6.3 Applying risk management
6.3.1 A similar process to reducing system problems could be used to examine how risk management 
methodology can be applied to improve SAR response and SAR system performance. This process

can be applied to any State regardless of its political system or organization structure.
6.3.2 Search and rescue (SAR) organizations have a lot to learn from the emergency management community 
where risk management principles are used so that the uncertainties that exist in potentially hazardous 
situations can be minimized and public safety maximized. Emergency managers commonly use three 
phases to describe their response to natural or technical disasters. They are preparedness (i.e. the

pre-disaster phase), response (i.e. the immediate post-disaster phase), and recovery (i.e. return to a 
normal state). From a SAR perspective, we could call these phases pre-incident, incident response 
and post-incident, with each phase requiring attention from SAR practitioners as they have a need 
to understand their particular role at that time, whether lead or support, and the interaction that is 
occurring within a broader government context.

occurring within a broader government context.
6.3.3 The application of risk management can bring order to the uncertain environment in which SAR 
organizations exist. It is a very valuable tool to determine future work priorities and to improve the 
ability to meet the organizational objective of finding persons in distress and removing them to a place 
of safety.
6.3.4 Risk analysis is a valuable tool for managers of SAR organizations as it can set the resource priorities

for an organization and its output can be used externally to promote SAR issues. SAR organizations 
are encouraged to undertake a risk analysis process and to use the information gained to advance the 
objective of saving lives.
6.3.5 An example of a Risk Management Process is at appendix L.
6.4 Cooperating to improve services
 Need for SAR managers to involve others
6.4.1 National and international expectations have greatly increased for SAR services to effectively and

efficiently conduct SAR operations. News media, next of kin of victims and others provide constant 
attention to SAR incidents and loss of life, and are quick to question the competency of a response. 
Lessons learned from previous disasters and their respective SAR responses have demonstrated that 
effective cooperation and coordination between a State’s SAR services and with other national SAR 
services is a critical component to any national SAR system.

6.4 Cooperating to improve services
 Need for SAR managers to involve others
6.4.1 National and international expectations have greatly increased for SAR services to effectively and 
efficiently conduct SAR operations. News media, next of kin of victims and others provide constant

attention to SAR incidents and loss of life, and are quick to question the competency of a response. 
Lessons learned from previous disasters and their respective SAR responses have demonstrated that 
effective cooperation and coordination between a State’s SAR services and with other national SAR 
services is a critical component to any national SAR system.
6.4.2 A national SAR system is comprised of three components that form a triangle:
Agency
integration
O rganization D ome stic
legal

Chapter 6 – Improving services
6-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
Convention, the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, and the Convention 
on International Civil Aviation. Within the domestic legal framework, States provide agency-
specific legal authorities for the conduct of SAR.
 – Organization: Built upon a State’s domestic legal framework, national and agency-specific SAR 
organization, policy, and procedures must be developed and implemented. A national SAR

system should be organized to promote the use of all available government agencies, industry 
stakeholders and volunteer organizations and resources to save lives. Funding and SAR resources 
must be made available to SAR authorities; training must be provided to ensure SAR planners 
and responders can effectively perform their assigned responsibilities.
 – Agency integration: Agency Integration is perhaps the most critical component to any national

SAR system. A State may have the domestic legal framework in place and have organized a 
national SAR system; however, if people, organizations and agencies are unwilling to work 
together to collaborate, cooperate, coordinate, manage and conduct SAR operations, then lives 
may be lost.
6.4.3 From a SAR system perspective, effective agency integration can be considered the willingness of 
people, agencies and organizations to work together within a national SAR system. Barriers to effective

agency integration include:
 – Agencies may be unwilling to share information and SAR resources. This is a particular concern 
between aeronautical and maritime SAR authorities: States may have fulfilled their international 
obligations concerning implementing a national SAR system, however, SAR agencies/organizations 
and personnel may be unwilling or unable to work together. This problem also occurs between

a State’s civil SAR authorities and the military. The unwillingness of civil and military authorities 
to coordinate and conduct SAR operations can hamper an effective SAR response.
 – Narrowly and rigidly defined agency responsibilities are strictly adhered to. As a result, there may 
be an unwillingness to assist in the coordination and conduct of SAR operations if a particular 
response is considered to be outside the scope of an agency’s normal responsibilities.

– Agencies are unwilling or reluctant to go through the process of improving SAR coordination, 
cooperation and response. Many may believe it is easier to keep the status quo rather than to 
improve a national SAR system.
 – The belief that there may be a loss of power or position if an agency/organization begins to 
collaborate and cooperate on SAR operations.
6.4.4 Managers should understand the importance of involving others in support of the SAR system

and seek to create an environment where such involvement thrives. Failure to do this often makes 
managers their own worst enemy. The nearly unique humanitarian and non-political nature of SAR is 
an inherent advantage in fostering cooperation and involvement of others. The SAR manager should 
work to overcome organizational traits, if they exist, such as the following:
 – limited communications between organizational elements;
 – focus only on short-term planning and cost reductions;

– more concern about detecting than preventing problems;
 – adversarial, blaming, and self-serving ways; and
 – rewarding heroes rather than successful teams.
6.4.5 SAR managers should associate with others to:
 – develop teamwork with other SAR personnel, suppliers and support agencies and with SAR 
personnel and organizations of other States;
 – improve communications and understanding between SAR organizations and other emergency

Chapter 6 – Improving services
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 6-5
 – do both short- and long- term planning for SAR services;
 – focus on continuous improvement and error prevention to provide the best SAR services possible; 
and
 – develop support of top management.
6.4.6 To minimize the lack of agency integration in a national SAR system, two factors should be considered:
 – establishment of a national SAR coordinating committee; and
 – creation of a national SAR plan.

– creation of a national SAR plan.
6.4.7 An effective process for SAR coordination is the establishment and use of SAR coordinating committees 
(SCCs) comprising SAR system stakeholders to provide a strategic, whole-of-government approach 
to national SAR system cooperation and coordination. The SCC can be established at SAR agency, 
national or regional level, and, ideally, at all three levels. SAR agency SCCs should deal with local

operational SAR issues and have the ability to refer matters higher if required. Committees established 
at a national level may consider strategic SAR policy matters and should have the ability to take matters 
to their respective governments for consideration. Regional SCCs should be able to refer SAR matters 
of a regional nature to their incorporated national committees for consideration. The establishment of

these SAR committees can improve and support the SAR system in a number of ways, including:
 – develop and recommend national strategic policy to their respective governments;
 – remove agency integration barriers by managing issues related to SAR policy, processes, 
organization, the sharing of best practices and lessons learned, as well as other areas to promote 
SAR cooperation;
 – provide a standing forum for coordination of administrative and operational SAR matters;

– develop plans, policies, positions, manuals, etc., to:
 – resolve cross-agency jurisdictional issues;
 – develop joint solutions for SAR matters of common concern;
 – assign and coordinate SAR responsibilities; and
 – develop and implement SAR requirements and standards.
 – establish agreements, requirements and/or guidelines for SAR services and others operating in 
areas remote from SAR facilities;

areas remote from SAR facilities;
 – the SAR authorities should define areas remote from SAR facilities within their SRR as necessary;  
 – the SAR authorities should identify conditions (e.g. weather, terrain, seasonal icing, sea state, 
etc.) in areas remote from SAR facilities, for the purpose of providing unique processes and 
procedures including contingency plans;
 – effectively use all available resources for SAR, including global, regional, national, private,

commercial, and volunteer resources (such resources may include advice, communications 
facilities and databases, ship reporting systems, training, SAR facilities, search planning expertise, 
technical assistance, foreign language assistance, medical or fuelling facilities, regulatory support 
and others);
 – develop common equipment, facilities and procedures as appropriate;
 – interface with other national and international organizations involved with emergency services;

Chapter 6 – Improving services
6-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
 – improve cooperation, communication and understanding among aeronautical, maritime and 
land SAR communities;
 – determine ways to enhance overall effectiveness and efficiency of SAR services;
 – promote safety programmes to help citizens avoid or cope with distress situations; and
 – develop contingency plans for use of SAR resources during disasters.

6.4.8 A national SAR plan or a regional SAR agreement should establish an SCC. This provides the process 
for SAR cooperation and coordination. Participating organizations would include those directly 
involved with SAR and those in a supporting role.
6.4.9 The national SAR plan or a regional SAR agreement should also contain any written agreement, 
which involves the sharing of responsibilities when conducting SAR missions in areas remote from

SAR facilities, and provide details on how responsibilities are assigned.
6.4.10 SAR managers may find it useful to establish regular conferences of representatives of departments 
and public and private concerns. This could gain the cooperation of those whose primary function 
is not SAR and would reach agreement on the respective roles to be performed by these facilities. 
Appendix J contains an SCC agreement. The sample is for a State SCC but the text can be reworded

for a regional SCC as well.
6.4.11  SAR stakeholders should implement a range of measures based on safety management principles. Each 
SAR stakeholder should ensure their internal management systems include the following components 
commensurate with their level of risk exposure and provide an annual statement to this effect to the 
National SAR Committee. A de-identified approach may be considered to optimize reporting rates

and the effectiveness of the approach. Measures which SAR stakeholders should consider include: 
 – service level agreements (SLAs) with the relevant SAR coordinators based on an agreed template 
setting out respective roles and responsibilities, services provided, availability, KPIs/SPIs and 
oversight arrangements; 
 – mechanisms for post incident and safety investigation lessons learned and management reviews;

– the provision of data for safety performance indicators, including post-accident/near miss lessons 
learned, and health and safety reviews; 
 – a register of SAR systems and operational risks, and the corrective or preventative actions that 
prevent or minimize risks and the possibility of sub-standard SAR performance; 
 – internal quality assurance mechanisms including regular internal audits of facilities and 
procedures; and

procedures; and 
 – certainty that the organization complies with the requirements of relevant national legislations, 
i.e. safety at work, maritime and aviation legislation, etc.
 Using international cooperation to improve SAR services
6.4.12 International cooperation such as the following can be used to improve SAR services:
 – training and exercises;
 – joint operational and long-range planning;
 – SCCs;
 – working relationships between SAR managers;
 – liaison visits between SAR personnel;

– liaison visits between SAR personnel;
 – sharing lessons learned from actual SAR incidents and exercises;
 – development of common SAR and communication procedures;
 – combined public education efforts;
 – collection, integration, analysis and use of SAR statistics;
 – establishment of JRCCs and information databases;
 – cooperation in research and development;
 – making fuelling and medical facilities and medical advice available on an international basis for 
SAR support;

SAR support;
 – cooperation in conducting safety inspections;
 – participation in organizations or systems such as IMO, ICAO, Cospas-Sarsat, IMO-recognized 
mobile satellite services and Amver; and
 – use and support of international SAR-related conventions, agreements and plans and manuals.
6.5 Reducing response time
6.5.1 The most important element in improving the effectiveness of SAR services is the reduction in the

elapsed time between when an incident occurs and when the persons in distress are rescued. A SAR 
manager may not be directly responsible for all efforts needed to minimize this elapsed time, but 
should work with others as necessary to address the vital time element.
6.5.2 All SAR incident aspects must be sensitive to timeliness, i.e. alerting, planning transit, location and 
rescue. Information derived from survival data and incidents involving fatalities indicates that two (2)

hours is generally the average critical time within which persons in distress must be rescued in order 
to survive. Initial action should begin within five minutes of initial notification of a distress incident.
6.5.3 Alert Phase activities, i.e. receiving knowledge of a distress incident, effectively processing that 
information, and directing appropriate response actions, can be improved upon by the following 
initiatives:

initiatives:
 – improving communications systems so that calls can be received directly from those in distress;
 – minimizing search time, particularly by promoting, supporting, and using systems such as 
Cospas-Sarsat;
 – developing and installing locating equipment;
 – providing access to ship reporting and vessel tracking systems (AIS, LRIT, VMS, VTS);
 – actively promoting and supporting IMO and ICAO efforts to improve distress alerting;

– supporting RCC automation research and development to expedite decision making and 
deployment of SAR facilities;
 – continually reviewing technology that might improve Alert Phase effectiveness and efficiency; 
and
 – reviewing historical incidents to identify and correct weaknesses in Alert Phase operations.
6.5.4 To improve SAR communications, SAR authorities should consider initiatives like the following:

– ensure that suitable national legislation and regulations are in place and support international 
aeronautical and maritime mobile service developments;
 – reduce total communication facility shortfalls and costs by sharing facilities between organizations 
or States with similar needs, and to serve multiple units which are co-located, or which can be 
suitably connected;
 – establish written communications maintenance plans, and written policies for communications

Chapter 6 – Improving services

Chapter 6 – Improving services
6-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
 – use landline, cable, or microwave when possible for point-to-point or fixed communications;
 – use the most efficient signal characteristics and control techniques commensurate with required 
reliability, speed, and traffic volume for long-range communications and line-of-sight techniques 
for short-range communications;
 – provide compatible communications for civil and military facilities used for SAR to the maximum

extent possible;
 – provide equipment and personnel adequate to handle both operational communications and 
distress, urgency and safety communications;
 – ensure that communications can be carried out rapidly with operating facilities, and that 
high-priority messages can be routed quickly;
 – ensure that personnel from different organizations are able to understand each other’s 
communications, especially matters concerning priority and risk;

– arrange for communications personnel to report observed frequency violations to enforcement 
authorities;
 – establish communications reliability goals for the coverage areas and assess performance;
 – institutionalize sufficient training for proper operation and administration of communication 
facilities;
 – ensure that commercial proprietary information, such as ship reports for SAR, remains 
proprietary and used only for SAR or safety purposes, to help safeguard continued availability

of this information;
 – ensure that distress communications are always recognized and handled as a higher priority than 
logistic, administrative, training and routine operational communications;
 – where practicable, enable SAR personnel to communicate directly with potential craft in distress, 
including aircraft, ships, fishing vessels, recreation vessels and other types of marine craft;
 – provide comprehensive distress communications throughout SRRs, but especially along the

coast and over land;
 – use automation techniques and phone patch capabilities to keep resource needs reasonable as 
workloads increase;
 – ensure that communications funding needs are included in SAR agency and SAR facility budget 
plans;
 – address personnel qualification and replacement needs from both a SAR and communications 
perspective;
 – prepare radio coverage charts;
 – develop written test and casualty restoration procedures; and

– cooperate with other organizations to provide disaster-recovery sites for each other for crucial 
alerting posts, computer centres and RCCs.
6.5.5 The following are some measures which SAR authorities can help implement to improve the land 
portion of distress alerting:
 – use dedicated circuits for land connection to RCCs from land facilities such as LESs, DSC coast 
stations, and MCCs and use switching and software arrangements to preserve message priority;

Chapter 6 – Improving services
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) 6-9
(which are now more and more being fitted with satellite communication (satcom) equipment 
linked to LESs);
 – upgrade circuits connecting RCCs with LESs and DSC coast stations using caller identification 
displays, where practicable, at the RCC for messages from vessels using an IMO-recognized 
mobile satellite service or DSC-initiated radiotelephone; and

– provide appropriate computer software to automatically decode message contents not in plain 
language prior to delivery of distress alerts to the RCC and automatically retrieve supporting 
emergency data on distressed aircraft and vessels from available databases as soon as possible 
for delivery to the RCC.
6.5.6 Transit time must be minimized. SRUs should get under way and arrive at the distress location, or in

the search area if the actual location is not known, without delay. The ways in which transit time can 
be minimized include:
 – review resource readiness standards to minimize resource unavailability (e.g. SAR equipment 
and personnel should be ready to deploy quickly, but not later than 30 minutes after notification);
 – review geographic sites of SAR facilities to ensure optimal placement for current and projected

distress incidents; consider closing, reducing, seasonalizing, or relocating units not optimally 
located or used (e.g. SAR units should arrive on scene within 90 minutes after deployment);
 – review the mix of resources at SAR facilities; ensure they are correct for the environment and 
types of incidents experienced or anticipated;
 – replace SAR resources as they exceed useful life, keep abreast of advancements in order to 
identify better and more cost-effective response resources;

– monitor SAR asset reliability and take corrective action as necessary;
 – standardize SRUs and maintenance when possible;
 – train personnel to ensure that they can safely and effectively conduct SAR operations in 
anticipated environment(s);
 – review and update SAR assistance policies in response to changing conditions;
 – maximize use of secondary sources of SAR resources in less critical cases in order to increase 
availability of additional experienced and capable resources;

– maintain close liaison with other organizations; know their capabilities to ensure that the most 
capable and timely resources, regardless of ownership, respond to SAR situations; and
 – review historical incidents and apply lessons learned to identify and correct transit weaknesses.
6.5.7 Maximize ability to locate, and provide assistance to, the distressed craft upon arrival in the search 
area, using actions such as the following:

area, using actions such as the following:
 – ensure that search units and sensors use the best visual and electronic sweep-width data 
available;
 – improve calculation of datum on the water, including use of real-time wind and current 
information;
 – increase probability of detection by using sensors;
 – consider crew fatigue when purchasing new search resources and in daily operations;
 – review and modify SAR training as necessary to optimize search effectiveness;

Chapter 6 – Improving services
6-10 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
 – review historical incidents and apply lessons learned to identify and correct on-scene operational 
weaknesses.
6.6 Mass rescue operations
6.6.1 A mass rescue operation (MRO) is characterized by a need for immediate response to large numbers 
of persons in distress such that capabilities normally available to SAR authorities are inadequate.

6.6.2 MROs occur less frequently than typical rescue efforts, but have high potential consequences. Flooding, 
earthquakes, terrorism, and large passenger aircraft or ship disasters are examples of scenarios that 
may involve the need for MROs. Extensive preparations and resources are required to conduct MROs 
successfully.
6.6.3 Such incidents might involve hundreds or thousands of persons in distress in remote and hostile

environments. A large passenger ship collision, for example, could call for rescue of thousands of 
passengers and crew in poor weather and sea conditions, with many of the survivors having little 
ability to help themselves. Preparedness to mount a large and rapid response would be critical to 
preventing large-scale loss of lives.
6.6.4 MRO incidents and exercises are complex and challenging. It is essential to plan for the effective

use of additional resources, beyond those normally used for SAR. Preparations require substantial 
commitments and partnerships among SAR authorities, regulatory authorities, transportation 
companies, sources of military and commercial assistance and others, often at the international as 
well as the national level.
6.6.5 MROs often need to be carried out and coordinated within a broader emergency response context

that may involve hazards mitigation, damage control and salvage operations, pollution control, 
complex traffic management, large-scale logistics, medical and coroner functions, accident-incident 
investigation, and intense public and political attention, etc. Efforts must often start immediately at an 
intense level and be sustainable for days or weeks.
6.6.6 SAR authorities should coordinate MRO plans with companies that operate aircraft and ships designed

to carry large numbers of persons. Such companies should share in preparations to prevent MROs and 
to help ensure success if they become necessary.
6.6.7 News and social media reports may matter more than what SAR authorities and operators do in 
shaping public opinion about MROs. There should be no unwarranted delays in providing information 
to the media. Information must be readily available, and freely exchanged among emergency service

providers and shipping, airline or other primary companies involved.
6.6.8 Since opportunities to handle actual incidents involving mass rescues are rare and challenging, 
exercising MRO plans is particularly important.
6.6.9 It is the SAR coordinator’s responsibility to engage with response organizations and to coordinate the 
necessary MRO planning, or to ensure that it is coordinated by a nominated authority. It is with the 
SAR coordinator that MRO preparation begins.

SAR coordinator that MRO preparation begins.
6.6.10 SAR managers’ responsibilities in terms of MRO planning may be summarized as follows:
 – Recognize the need for MRO preparation.
 – Liaise with the SAR coordinator and all organizations with a potential response role, to identify 
individual organizations’ responsibilities and capabilities and to develop measures to mitigate 
shortfalls in overall MRO capability.
 – Establish and support a coordinated planning process.

– Ensure that the planning includes the necessary additional SAR resources, including staffing, 
equipment, management, coordination and communications resources.
 – Ensure that the planning includes the necessary training and testing regimes.
 – Ensure that any necessary legal provisions are in place.
 – Ensure that sufficient funding is in place for the planning and preparation phases, and that 
policies are agreed that will ensure that any cost questions arising at the time of an MRO will

not delay response.
 – Ensure that the resulting plans are understood and agreed by all who will have to implement 
them, and that they are kept current.
6.6.11 The International Maritime Rescue Federation (IMRF) has developed detailed guidance on preparing 
for maritime MROs. This may be downloaded from www.imrfmro.org.

 Safety

Safety
6.7. 2 SAR organizations should establish plans and procedures to ensure that multiple aircraft SAR operations 
can be performed efficiently while flight safety is maintained.
 Notes: 
1. Depending on the State’s aviation regulatory framework, SAR organizations may need to work 
in conjunction and collaboration with the relevant State civil aviation regulatory, air navigation 
service providers and military aviation authorities to establish such plans and procedures.

2. Plans and procedures need to take into account possible operational and procedural differences 
that may exist between civil and military operations.
 Common Procedures
6.7. 3 Differences in the availability of airborne SRUs, capabilities and geography across different SRRs, cause 
regional differences in plans for multiple aircraft SAR operations. Significant differences may increase 
risks to safety during operations in which aircraft, SRUs or staff from different SAR organizations work

together. 
6.7.4 In order to promote safety, effectiveness and best practice, it is important that SAR organizations 
develop plans for multiple aircraft SAR operations based on common procedures and principles. 
Relevant procedures and principles are described in the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, chapter 7 and 
volume III, section 10.
6.7. 5 It is recommended that SAR organizations share their experiences and recommendations for multiple

aircraft SAR operations with each other, and their State civil and military aviation authorities, to 
improve procedures and plans.
6.8 Research and development
6.8.1 Research and development efforts for SAR, carried out either alone or in cooperation with other 
States, often lead to improvements in SAR services. The focus of such efforts usually is to develop 
data, procedures, or equipment which will make SAR services more effective. Finding ways to exploit

new and emerging technologies for SAR to do more with less is a common focus of research and 
development. Other parts of this chapter may suggest fruitful areas for research and development 
efforts.
6.8.2 Research and development results should be shared to reduce the risk of duplicated efforts and 
to maximize the benefits of the results. States which may not be directly involved in research and

Appendix C
Sources for SAR assistance
C.1 State, provincial and local government departments
C.1.1 Many Government departments can give valuable aid to SAR operations. The national SAR Plan 
should specify the extent and manner in which each department is expected to aid the SAR system 
when called upon. Consideration should be given to calling upon public departments for assistance,

rather than upon private concerns, as the latter may demand considerable payment for services. 
Examples of public departments and the facilities they may provide for SAR assistance are:
.1 Agricultural and forestry departments. Personnel and organization for land searches, fire fighters 
and first-aid personnel, communication networks, light aircraft and helicopters.
.2 Broadcasting stations. Communications networks and public information broadcasts.

.3 Civil aviation administrations. Air traffic services personnel, communications networks and 
departmental aircraft.
.4 Coastguard and lifeboat authorities . Where established, these authorities are typically the 
primary source of maritime SAR assistance. The services which these authorities may provide 
cover a wide range, but the following are among the more important:
 – trained personnel and specialized, all-weather SAR equipment;
 – medical assistance and emergency medical evacuation;

– alerting posts, communications networks, direction-finding and radio facilities;
 – survival equipment; and
 – testing, prototype and experimental equipment.
.5 Electric and public works departments . First-aid personnel, helicopters and communication 
lines.
.6 Fire departments. Fire departments are often focal points to which the general public turns for 
help or to report an accident. They may provide:
 – alerting post services; and

– alerting post services; and
 – rescue units, including vessels, ambulances, emergency medical technician teams and 
fire-fighting brigades.
.7 Health departments. Hospital and first-aid facilities, ambulances and medical stations in remote 
areas, telemedical assistance services (TMAS).
.8 Hydrographic and other marine survey departments. Marine navigation warnings and information, 
and vessels.
.9 Land survey departments. Aircraft, aerial photography and photo-interpretation personnel.

Appendix C – Sources for SAR assistance
C-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
.13 Military services. Often the military services are the best source of all-weather facilities and trained 
personnel, rivalling even an established coastguard or lifeboat service in SAR capabilities. With 
their communications networks, military operations centres make excellent sites for co-locating 
an RCC.
.14 Police departments, including municipal, State or provincial police forces. Police departments

are focal points to which the general public often report abnormal observations. SAR-related 
services that police departments may provide are:
 – alerting posts;
 – helicopters, small aircraft, rescue boats and land search parties;
 – communications facilities;
 – traffic control; and
 – fencing and guarding of accident sites.
.15 Railway departments. Communication networks.
.16 Telephone and telegraph departments. Communications networks and repair personnel.
C.2 Communications facilities

C.2 Communications facilities
C.2.1 Communications are vital to an effective SAR system. The SAR system must have ways to receive 
distress alerts and to direct the efforts of responding SAR facilities. Immediate access to the lines of 
communication owned by Government departments and private concerns is most important. SAR 
managers should ensure that, whenever possible, each RCC has access to the following communications 
networks:
.1 air traffic services networks;
.2 amateur radio stations;

.2 amateur radio stations;
.3 State-owned and private broadcasting stations;
.4 cable, telephone and telegraphic corporations;
.5 coast radio stations;
.6 meteorological communications networks;
.7 military communications networks;
.8 railway communications systems;
.9 dedicated SAR communications networks;
.10 satellite communications systems, e.g. IMO-recognized mobile satellite services and Cospas-Sarsat; 
and
.11 transport communications systems.
C.3 Aircraft operating agencies

C.3 Aircraft operating agencies
C.3.1 Arrangements should be made with aircraft operating agencies for their cooperation in SAR. They may 
be able to provide limited assistance by:
.1 requesting air crews to keep a visual or radio watch for aircraft or vessels lost in the vicinity of 
their route;
.2 diverting en-route aircraft to the extent practicable for SAR purposes;
.3 making suitable aircraft and crews available for SAR operations;

Appendix C – Sources for SAR assistance
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) C-3
C.4 Fishing vessels, yachts and small craft
C.4.1 Fishing vessels, yachts and other private small craft are sources from which volunteer assistance may 
be obtained. Those sources will have various levels of training in SAR operations. Police, customs and 
harbour authorities also usually have small craft suitable for SAR operations in coastal or protected 
waters.
C.5 Merchant vessels

waters.
C.5 Merchant vessels
C.5.1 Several international conventions require that the master of a vessel, on receiving a message that 
persons are in distress at sea, proceeds to assist them when it can be done without undue risk to the 
safety of the responding vessel and crew.
C.5.2 Vessels at sea, although not always available to participate in extended search operations, are 
potential SAR assets. Masters of vessels have a duty to assist others whenever it can be done without

endangering the assisting vessel or crew. Ship reporting and vessel tracking systems enable the SMC 
to quickly know the approximate positions, courses, and speeds of vessels in the vicinity of a distress 
situation and other information about the vessels which may be valuable, e.g. whether a doctor is 
aboard. Masters of vessels sailing the areas of concern should be encouraged to send regular reports

to the authority operating a ship reporting system for SAR in the area. Ships are a key SAR resource 
for RCCs, but requests for them to assist must be weighed against the considerable cost to shipping 
companies when they do divert to assist. Ship reporting systems enable RCCs to quickly identify the 
capable vessel which will be least harmed by a diversion, enabling other vessels in the vicinity to be 
unaffected. The basic functional requirements of a ship reporting system are:

.1 one or more communications stations that receive and relay vessels’ reporting messages;
.2 a facility (personnel and equipment) for recording, plotting, updating and filing vessels’ reports;
.3 a standard operating procedure available to participating ships; and
.4 immediate access to system information by any RCC which may need the data.
C.6 Auxiliaries
C.6.1 Auxiliaries, both maritime and aeronautical, are organizations which provide training and an operational

framework for privately owned craft that volunteer to do SAR. Though not specifically designed for 
SAR, these craft frequently are useful over land and in coastal waters. These craft vary in size, type, 
design, power, endurance and durability. SAR planners should maintain updated information on how 
to contact these volunteer resources and be familiar with their capabilities and limitations.
C.7 Sports clubs and similar organizations

C.7 Sports clubs and similar organizations
C .7.1 Aviation clubs, parachute jumping clubs, scouting troops, mountain climbing and hiking clubs may 
give valuable assistance, particularly with SAR over land. Aircraft operated by parachute clubs may be 
used for dropping supplies and aircraft operated by aviation clubs may be used for air searches that 
must be conducted at low speed and altitudes in areas well known to the pilots.
C.8 Commercial businesses

False alerts
E.1 Importance of preventing false alerts
E.1.1 False alerts are any alerts received by the SAR system which indicate an actual or potential distress 
situation, when no such situation actually exists. Some causes of false alerts include equipment 
malfunctions, interference, testing and inadvertent human error. A false alert transmitted deliberately 
is called a hoax.

is called a hoax.
E.1.2 With the advent of more alerting equipment which transmits automatic pre-formatted data messages, 
a tendency for the numbers of false alerts received to increase is inevitable. If counter-measures 
are not developed, this will place increasing strain on the SAR system, bring increasing risk to SAR 
personnel and harm the credibility of alerting systems needed to inform the SAR system when help is 
needed.

needed.
E.1.3 It is essential that SAR personnel treat every distress alert as genuine until they know differently.
E.2 Preventing false alerts
E.2.1 Steps SAR authorities can take to reduce false alerts are suggested below:
 – inform aircraft and vessel owners and operators about implications of the rising number of false 
distress alerts;
 – provide for vessels to properly register all communications equipment, and to ensure that this 
registration data is readily available to RCCs;

registration data is readily available to RCCs;
 – consider establishing or using enforcement measures to prosecute those who:
 – inadvertently transmit a false distress alert without proper cancellation, or who fail to 
respond to a distress acknowledgement due to misuse or negligence;
 – repeatedly transmit false alerts; and
 – deliberately transmit false alerts.
 – use the ITU violation reporting process for false distress alerts;

– ensure that communications equipment operators are well informed on how to operate their 
equipment, the importance of avoiding false alerts and steps to be taken to prevent transmitting 
false alerts;
 – inform equipment approval authorities of false alert problems to draw their attention to testing 
and alerting functions of radio equipment during the type approval process;
 – urge companies installing radio equipment to train the users to ensure they become familiar with

Appendix E – False alerts
E-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
 – require that operators be appropriately certificated for installed communications equipment;
 – urge manufacturers, suppliers, and installers of communications equipment to:
 – provide clear and precise operating instructions that are easy to understand (maintenance 
and operating instructions should be separated, and should be delivered in English and any 
other language deemed necessary);

other language deemed necessary);
 – ensure that supplier and installation personnel understand how the equipment works and 
the consequences of transmitting a false alert;
 – ensure that equipment is designed for distress alerting so that it will be impossible to transmit 
an alert unintentionally; any panel for emergency operation is separated from the one for 
normal operation, is fitted with a cover, and has colour-coded switches; and that there are

standardized arrangements of control panels and standard operational procedures;
 – design test features so that testing equipment will not result in false distress alerts;
 – ensure that when any communications equipment has been installed, necessary 
instructions are given to users, specifically pointing out the operating procedures (log that 
the instructions have been given);
 – ensure that any distress alert activation is indicated visually and/or aurally, showing that the

equipment is transmitting a distress alert, until manually deactivated;
 – implement any appropriate technical and operational measures to avoid unwanted 
transmission of alerts;
 – ensure that the ELT or EPIRB handling procedures and installations, including the location 
on board the aircraft or vessel and the release and activation mechanisms, preclude 
unwanted activation;
 – design EPIRBs so that when they are out of their brackets they must also be immersed in

water to activate automatically; when operated manually, a two-step activation procedure 
should be required; and
 – consider ELT and EPIRB installation locations for new aircraft and vessels at early stages of 
the craft design and construction.
 – urge trainers and educators to:
 – ensure that aviation and maritime education centres are informed and teach about false 
alert problems and implications to safety and SAR;
 – obtain and use actual case histories as examples when teaching;

– emphasize the need to avoid false distress alerts in all aviation and maritime training and 
education; and
 – ensure that no inadvertent transmissions of false distress alerts occur during communications 
training.
 – educate users of communications equipment and their employers to:
 – ensure that all personnel responsible for sending a distress alert have been instructed and 
are competent to operate all radio equipment aboard the aircraft or vessel;

– have the person(s) responsible for communications during distress incidents give necessary 
instructions and information to any crew members who should know how to send a distress 
alert;
 – give instruction to the crew during each drill on evacuating the aircraft or vessel on how 
emergency equipment should be used for emergency functions;
 – ensure that equipment testing is only undertaken under supervision of the person responsible 
for communications during distress incidents;

Appendix E – False alerts
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) E-3
 – ensure that equipment testing or drills are never allowed to cause false distress alerts;
 – ensure that encoded identities of 406 MHz distress beacons (ELTs, EPIRBs and PLBs), 
which are used by SAR personnel responding to emergencies, are properly registered in 
a database accessible 24 h per day or automatically provided to SAR authorities (aircraft

and vessel operators should confirm that their beacons have been registered with such a 
database to help SAR services to identify the unit in the event of distress and to rapidly 
obtain other information to help them respond);
 – immediately update 406 MHz distress beacon, ship earth stations using IMO-recognized 
mobile satellite services and DSC registration data and, if necessary, reprogram the 
equipment codes, if the aircraft or vessel change ownership, name, flag, or similar

information;
 – install and maintain ELTs and EPIRBs carefully in accordance with manufacturers’ 
instructions and using qualified personnel;
 – avoid activating EPIRBs if help is already available (EPIRBs are intended to call for assistance 
if the vessel is unable to obtain help by other means, and provide position information and 
homing signals for SAR units);
 – once an EPIRB is switched on intentionally, the vessel should make every reasonable attempt

to communicate with SAR authorities by other means to advise them of the situation;
 – if an EPIRB is accidentally activated, it should be turned OFF as soon as practicable and the 
RCC should be notified that the alert is false. In cases where the beacon cannot be turned 
OFF, measures should be taken to prevent or inhibit the transmission of signal. Such actions 
may render the beacon inoperable for future use unless it is serviced by an appropriate 
service facility;

service facility;
 – after emergency use, if possible, retrieve and deactivate the EPIRB;
 – when a 406 MHz distress beacon is damaged and needs to be disposed of, or if an 
aircraft or vessel is sold for scrap or for any other reason a beacon will no longer be used, 
ensure that it is made inoperable by removing its battery if possible and returning it to the 
manufacturer or demolishing it;
 – take measures, such as wrapping the 406 MHz distress beacon in tin foil, to prevent

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) G-1
Appendix G
Mobile communication services
G.1 ITU Radio Regulations
G.1.1 The ITU Radio Regulations , which were developed in cooperation with its Member States and 
IMO and ICAO, provide for use of radio frequencies with which SAR personnel should be familiar. 
Following is an overview of mobile services and the frequencies they use.
G.1.2 The Regulations and other ITU documents referred to in this appendix may be obtained from ITU.

G.2 Aeronautical mobile service (AMS)
G.2.1 Frequency bands allocated by ITU for the aeronautical mobile service include some in the high 
frequency (HF) spectrum (3,000 to 30,000 kHz), others in the very-high frequency (VHF) spectrum 
(30 to 300 MHz) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) (300 MHz to 3,000 MHz).
G.2.2 ICAO Regional Air Navigation Plans (RANPs) or other regional SAR plans or agreements may provide 
guidance on selection of appropriate aeronautical frequency bands for SAR.

G.2.3 RANPs and other documents of ICAO referred to in this appendix may be obtained by contacting 
ICAO.
G.2.4 Annex 10 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation allocates blocks of VHF band frequencies 
for aircraft; certain of these are allocated for specific purposes, while others are assignable. Annex 10 
provides the basis for regional plans, such as provisions found in the applicable RANP .

G.2.5 121.5 MHz services are normally available at any aeronautical facility where needed to ensure 
immediate reception of distress calls. Aerodromes should always monitor 121.5 MHz for voice 
emergency calls and ELT aural signals (which have a WOW WOW sound from the transmission of 
two alternating tones). 123.1 MHz can be used for on-scene communications.
G.3 Communications between vessels and aircraft

G.3 Communications between vessels and aircraft
G.3.1 Designated SAR aircraft operating in maritime areas are required to be equipped with a frequency for 
communicating with vessels during SAR operations.
G.3.2 It may help to equip a SAR aircraft with an automatic alarm signal device to enable it to indicate 
directly to a ship that it wishes to communicate with it. This will allow the aircraft to avoid the delay

that would result from the use of relay stations. However, a SAR organization can effectively overcome 
this factor by providing means of immediate communications and developing procedures whereby 
ships in the areas to be searched are requested to guard a specific frequency. This would allow a SAR 
aircraft to establish immediate communications with the vessels concerned.
G.3.3 Communications between SAR aircraft and civil aircraft could also be effected by providing SAR

Appendix G – Mobile communication services
G-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
G.3.4 Additional information about the types of equipment and systems used aboard aircraft, vessels, 
and survival craft can be obtained from IMO and ICAO publications, Government communication 
authorities, service providers, equipment manufacturers, appropriate training institutions, etc.
G.3.5 The installation of automatic radiotelephone alarm signal devices or carriage of DSC-capable radios is

a matter for determination by SAR authorities in light of use that may be made of such devices in the 
areas concerned, particularly with regard to the number of ships carrying this equipment.
G.3.6 In accordance with the SOLAS Convention, every passenger ship shall be provided with means 
for two-way on-scene radiocommunications for SAR purposes using the aeronautical frequencies 
121.5 MHz and 123.1 MHz from the position from which the ship is normally navigated.
G.4 Maritime radio service

G.4 Maritime radio service
G.4.1 Vessels communicate with coast radio stations and with each other on maritime frequencies available 
in MF, HF and VHF bands.
G.4.2 Medium frequencies (MF – 300 to 3,000 kHz), seldom used by aircraft, are commonly used for 
maritime services.
G.4.3 A wide range of maritime HF frequencies (3,000–30,000 kHz) are allocated and subdivided for 
radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony. HF radio can be useful in polar regions where geostationary

satellite coverage may be limited. Also, HF email capability exists.
G.4.4 The frequency 156.8 MHz (channel 16) is the international VHF maritime voice distress, safety and 
calling frequency. The frequency 156.3 MHz (channel 06) may be used for communications on scene. 
AIS transmission from ships provides vessel identity, location and other information which can be 
useful for SAR purposes.
G.5 Global Maritime Distress and Safety System

G.5 Global Maritime Distress and Safety System
G.5.1 Ships subject to the SOLAS Convention are obliged to be outfitted with certain communications 
equipment, collectively referred to as the shipboard portion of the Global Maritime Distress and 
Safety System (GMDSS). Certain fishing vessels and other marine craft may also be obligated to carry 
GMDSS-compatible equipment, or may do so voluntarily.
G.5.2 Development of GMDSS was recommended by the SAR experts who drafted the IMO International

Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue in Hamburg, Germany in 1979. The intent of the 
recommendation was to develop communications adequate to support the global SAR Plan prescribed 
by the Convention and to improve maritime safety.
G.5.3 The SAR Convention and other IMO documents can be obtained from IMO.
G.5.4 GMDSS also addresses problems like radio congestion; delayed, poor-quality and limited-range

communications; uncertainty about receipt of messages; and vessels vanishing without a trace or a 
successful call for help. When the system is mature, it should be able to provide alerting and locating 
with minimal delay, automatic alerting, a reliable network for SAR communications, integration of 
satellite and terrestrial communications and adequate frequencies in all maritime bands.

G.5.5 Administrations must ensure that installed shoreside communications facilities are sufficient to support 
shipboard GMDSS equipment. Furthermore, GMDSS can only work when an agreed international 
SAR plan is developed in accordance with the IMO SAR Convention to ensure that SAR services are 
available and that alerts can be routed quickly and reliably to the proper place within the SAR system.

G.5.6 RCC personnel should be familiar with the SOLAS GMDSS provisions and associated IMO documents. 
The general goal of GMDSS is to take advantage of available technology to shift alerting emphasis 
from ship-to-ship (though this can still be done), towards ship-to-shore where SAR professionals can 
help arrange assistance. GMDSS capabilities of vessels not subject to SOLAS may range from full 
compliance with SOLAS to no GMDSS capabilities at all.

Appendix G – Mobile communication services
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) G-3
G.5.7 GMDSS aboard only some vessels adds capabilities for those vessels, but also introduces 
incompatibility between those vessels and vessels not GMDSS-equipped. It also introduces need for 
SAR authorities to support two maritime mobile systems, both ashore and afloat. IMO recognizes 
this incompatibility and has developed guidance on some matters common to SOLAS Convention

vessels and non-regulated craft. IMO has decided that all GMDSS ships, while at sea, shall continue to 
maintain, when practicable, a continuous listening watch on VHF channel 16 since most small vessels 
will still depend on channel 16 for distress, safety and calling.
G.5.8 Modern communications tend to offer challenges, e.g. new training requirements and more complex 
equipment controls; relatively low reliability of automated distress alerts; varying levels of integration

of GMDSS systems; inadequacy of supporting databases; and incomplete development of related 
shore-based infrastructure. Until these matters are resolved, the level of effort needed for training SAR 
personnel and others on communications matters, and for coping with and reducing difficulties with 
GMDSS, will be substantial.
G.5.9 The equipment which ships must carry to comply with SOLAS may be affected by CRSs with DSC

availability, NAVTEX transmitters, etc. For example, if a State does not provide short-range DSC coastal 
coverage, ships must outfit with longer-range equipment even if it sails only in those coastal waters.
G.5.10 Another key consideration is that expensive land-based receivers for longer-range systems, like HF 
DSC or satellite systems, do not generally need to be duplicated by all States in an area; cooperative

arrangements for provision and use of such equipment can not only reduce costs, but can simplify 
distribution of distress alerts.
G.6 Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System
G.6.1 The Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS) was established to mitigate challenges 
in the global air navigation system regarding the timely identification and localization of aircraft in 
distress. GADSS provides an effective and globally consistent approach to enhancing the alerting

procedures of search and rescue services by addressing a number of key improvement areas. 
G.6.2  GADSS has three main elements: 
 – aircraft tracking (typically between the ATS unit and the aircraft operator); 
 – location of an aircraft in distress (achieved through autonomous distress tracking (ADT) of aircraft 
in flight); and 
 – post-flight localization and recovery. 
G.6.3  GADSS ensures an up-to-date record of aircraft progress is maintained and, in case of a crash, forced

landing or ditching, ensures information on the location of survivors, the aircraft and recoverable flight 
data is available. 
G.6.4  For GADSS to function as intended, flight crew and aircraft operators, air traffic controllers and air 
navigation services providers, ADT service providers and rescue coordination centres (RCCs) need 
to understand each other’s roles, responsibilities and processes to ensure effective communication,

robust coordination and harmonized implementation across the globe. 
G.6.5  For aircraft tracking in GADSS, the aircraft operator is required to establish an aircraft tracking capability 
throughout its area of operations. Such tracking is required in oceanic areas (airspace which overlies 
waters outside of the territory and territorial sea of a State) and recommended in all areas of operations.

Tracking is accomplished through automated four-dimensional (latitude, longitude, altitude and time) 
position reports transmitted at an interval of 15 minutes or less, unless ATS surveillance obtains aircraft 
position information at 15-minute intervals or less. 
G.6.6  The location of an aircraft in distress (achieved through autonomous distress tracking (ADT) of aircraft 
in flight) element has the greatest potential impact upon aeronautical and maritime SAR services.

Appendix G – Mobile communication services
G-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
G.6.7  The standard defining location of an aircraft in distress requires that, as of 1 January 2023, aircraft 
issued with a certificate of airworthiness for the first time, with a maximum certificated take off mass 
of over 27 ,000 kg, “shall autonomously transmit information from which a position can be determined

by the operator at least once every minute, when in distress.” The ICAO provisions also recommend 
that this requirement be applied to aircraft with a maximum certificated take off mass of over 5,700 kg. 
G.6.8  More detailed information on responsibilities and procedures regarding ADT and aspects of post-flight 
localization and recovery is provided in the IAMSAR Manual, volume II, Mission Coordination , 
Appendix V – Autonomous distress tracking of aircraft in flight.

G.7 406 MHz distress beacons
G .7.1 There are three types of 406 MHz distress beacons: the maritime emergency position-indicating radio 
beacon (EPIRB) which is part of the GMDSS, the aeronautical emergency locator transmitter (ELT) and 
the personal locator beacon (PLB). All three types of this distress beacon have their signals relayed via 
Cospas-Sarsat satellites, local user terminals (LUTs) and mission control centres (MCCs) to SAR points 
of contact (SPOCs) which include RCCs.

of contact (SPOCs) which include RCCs.
G .7. 2 Many civil aircraft worldwide, especially operating on international flights and over ocean areas, are 
required to carry the 406 MHz distress beacon. However, some national regulations may allow for the 
121.5 MHz ELT on domestic flights. This old-style ELT depends on other aircraft or airport facilities to 
detect its aural signal.
G .7. 3 Most 406 MHz distress beacons provide a homing capability on 121.5 MHz, 243 MHz and 406 MHz

and some may also integrate SARTs into their designs. EPIRBs installed on or after 1 July 2022 will also 
be provided with an AIS locating signal.
G .7.4 Users of ELTs and EPIRBs need to be made aware how to properly install, register, and use this 
equipment and of what happens when these devices are activated. They should understand that 
these are the alerting means of last resort and should not be depended upon to replace two-way 
communications as the primary means of alerting.

communications as the primary means of alerting.
G .7. 5 The 406 MHz PLB is not a mandated international carriage requirement but may be carried on a person 
and has similar characteristics to EPIRBs and ELTs. However, the PLB has different specifications.
G.8 Satellite communications
G.8.1 The primary systems now used for SOLAS compliance are Cospas-Sarsat and IMO-recognized mobile 
satellite services.

satellite services.
G.8.2 The most capable Inmarsat equipment can handle distress communications, telephone, telex, facsimile, 
data and other general services. The Inmarsat-C SES does not handle voice communications, but it is 
important because of its ability to receive maritime safety information, relatively low cost to obtain 
and operate, versatile when coupled with a personal computer and in widespread use. Inmarsat SESs

communicate to subscribers ashore via national and international public switched telephone networks 
(PSTNs) and public switched data networks (PSDNs) which interlink Inmarsat to other systems and 
can also communicate with suitably equipped SESs in any ocean area.
G.8.3 For more information on equipment, performance standards, alert messages, distribution procedures, 
user manuals and other related matters, the IMO-recognized mobile satellite service providers may be 
contacted.

contacted.
G.8.4 Many people voluntarily use IMO-recognized mobile satellite services and similar global or regional 
systems using the same frequencies. Users need to know how these systems work, how to use the 
equipment in emergencies, and how to ensure that position information is correctly and continually 
updated for distress alerting. If users send an alert, they need to be prepared to be contacted by an

Appendix G – Mobile communication services
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) G-5
receive safety and SAR broadcasts. Users should be taught to follow up their semi-automatic (distress 
button) alerting with additional information to SAR authorities when possible.
G.8.5 New satellite systems are emerging which can relay distress alerts. Many vessels are equipped 
with systems that provide comprehensive online connections to Internet, voice, facsimile and data

communications for such functions as online email, short message system (SMS), video conferencing 
and medical examination and reporting. These commercial satellite systems are not primarily designed 
for alerting but may be used for subsequent SAR communications between ships or aircraft and RCCs 
or RSCs, or as a link to the on-scene coordinator.
G.9 EGC services
G.9.1 EGC services can and should also be used to broadcast MSI. Every RCC should make arrangements

with an associated NAVAREA coordinator or other authority authorized by the IMO EGC Coordinating 
Panel to make such broadcasts on its behalf over EGC services.
G.9.2 It is appropriate and advisable to promulgate distress alerts over both NAVTEX and EGC services. 
SOLAS ships and many fishing and other vessels sailing within NAVTEX coverage areas can be 
expected to carry 518 kHz NAVTEX receivers. However, some may carry equipment to receive MSI

over EGC services in lieu of, or in addition to, NAVTEX, and some may carry neither.
G.9.3 While EGC services and NAVTEX are valuable tools for SAR personnel, due to the ranges of shore 
facilities which transmit these broadcasts, not every State needs to provide the equipment. Normally, 
provision of these services should be arranged, provided, and shared on an international basis to 
maintain appropriate global broadcast coordination, reduce redundant alerts to vessels and reduce

costs of providing these services.
G.10 Mobile telephone – satellite and cellular
G.10.1 A mobile telephone can be a satellite or cellular telephone. The satellite telephone connects to orbiting 
satellites and can provide regional or global coverage. Cellular telephones connect to a local terrestrial 
network of radiocommunications base stations known as cell sites. The mobile telephone enables the

caller to connect to and from the public telephone network, including other mobile telephones, and 
fixed telephone lines. Portable satellite and cellular telephone systems were not developed as part of 
the international SAR system and have limitations for distress alerting. But, since any available means 
may be used for distress alerting, national administrations should make appropriate arrangements and 
establish procedures to handle distress alerts from mobile telephones.

SAR agreements
Notes regarding SAR agreements and the sample agreement that begins on the following page:
Parties may be organizations within a State, maritime and/or aeronautical SAR authorities of two or more 
different States (particularly with neighbouring search and rescue regions), or higher authorities of two or more 
States, i.e. the sample agreement can be adapted for local, national, or international use.

Each section of the sample agreement may be optionally used or adapted as the Parties agree, bearing in 
mind consistency with the principles of international law, and the goals of IMO, ICAO and the States and 
organizations concerned.
It is generally advisable to include specific information, such as phone numbers or addresses, in appendices 
or other documents separate from the basic signed agreement.

When Search and Rescue Regions (SRRs) are addressed in the agreements, normally only the lines separating 
the SRRs of the Parties are described, since other delimitation of the SRRs would normally involve States other 
than the Parties. Agreements between national organizations may or may not need to address geographic 
areas of responsibility. It should be recognized among the Parties that the establishment of SRRs is mainly for

ensuring the availability of SAR services, and to facilitate proper distribution of distress alerts to RCCs; SRRs 
should not be viewed as affecting political boundaries, and do not need to align with political boundaries if the 
Parties so agree for the sake of improving or simplifying SAR operations. SRR delimitation over international 
waters is not intended to obstruct the provision of SAR services in any way. Furthermore, the provision of SAR

services within an SRR shall be without regard to the nationality or circumstances of the persons in distress.
If agreements discuss territorial entry for SAR, provisions should account for a balance of concerns for 
sovereignty and concerns for saving lives.
The concept of “territory” is understood to include territorial land, territorial sea and the airspace above them.
It is advisable that SAR agreements address sensitive issues to the degree necessary for practical SAR

cooperation between or among the Parties, while emphasizing the humanitarian nature of SAR, and avoiding 
topics which are unrelated to SAR, or which are both politically sensitive and unnecessary.
IMO and ICAO use the term “agreement” but many States view this as a type of legal instrument. Different 
terms may be used for the title of a legal instrument, such as “Agreement”, “Memorandum of Understanding”,

“Arrangement” and other related terms. The type of instrument can be decided by the States involved as long 
as the document meets the intent of the international conventions to serve as the basis for cooperation and 
the provision of expeditious and effective SAR services.
In some cases, the term “Search and Rescue Point of Contact (SPOC)” can be used in lieu of Rescue 
Coordination Centre (RCC). The definition of SPOC includes the RCC and some national SAR authorities that

  Agreement FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE [name of national agency/State] 
AND [name of national agency/State]
  Note: The term “agreement” is used in order to be consistent with ICAO Annex 12 and the International 
Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979. State may elect to use a different term such as

“Memorandum of Understanding”, “Letter of understanding”, “Arrangement” or others as appropriate.
  This template serves as guidance for States to draft a SAR Agreement (which may take the form of an 
MOU or SAR Arrangement or other instrument title) and the text to be included in this document is 
for the Parties involved to decide.
Concerning aeronautical [and/or] maritime search and rescue
1 Introduction

1 Introduction
1.1  The [name of national agency/State] and [name of national agency/State] (hereinafter referred to as 
the “Parties” in this Agreement), recognize the benefits enjoyed from previous close cooperation 
with regard to search and rescue (SAR) operations and training, and further recognize that additional 
benefits may be enjoyed from the cooperative arrangements detailed herein.

1.2  The Parties have been recognized by their respective governments as having primary responsibility for 
coordinating and providing aeronautical and maritime SAR services in their respective aeronautical 
and maritime SAR regions.
1.3  The Parties recognize the great importance of cooperation in aeronautical and maritime SAR, and in 
the provision of expeditious and effective SAR services to save lives and reduce suffering and have

assumed their respective responsibilities for SAR within the framework of the International Convention 
on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979, the Convention on International Civil Aviation, 1944, and the 
International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual.
1.4  The Parties have accordingly reached the following understanding.
2 Objectives and scope
2.1  This agreement establishes a framework for cooperation among the Parties in carrying out activities

related to SAR within the aeronautical and/or maritime environment and sets out their various 
responsibilities.
2.2  The Parties should ensure close coordination with their respective national aeronautical and maritime 
SAR authorities to help promote common and effective SAR services under this agreement.
3 Responsibilities
3.1  [name of national agency] and [name of national agency] are each responsible for the maintenance of

safety of life and within their respective aeronautical and maritime SAR regions, under their respective 
rescue coordination centre (RCC).
3.2  Each Party, on receiving information of an incident where any person is in distress within its SAR 
region, should take urgent measures to provide the most appropriate assistance regardless of the 
nationality or status of such a person, or the circumstances in which that incident occurred or is 
detected.

Appendix I – SAR agreements
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) I-3
3.4  The Parties should make every effort to retrieve persons in distress, provide for their initial medical or 
other needs and deliver them to a place of safety; additionally, when it does not involve excessive risk 
or cost to the units involved in SAR operations, the Parties may attempt to rescue the craft or vessel 
on which the persons in danger are aboard.

on which the persons in danger are aboard.
3.5  To ensure that SAR operations are conducted in an efficient and coordinated manner, the Parties 
should consult and cooperate with each other as necessary and appropriate, lending mutual assistance 
as their capabilities allow.
3.6  Either Party may conduct SAR operations within the SAR region of the other Party under the 
coordination of that other Party’s RCC.

coordination of that other Party’s RCC.
3.7  Entry of the SAR units of one Party into or over the territory of the other Party for the purpose of 
conducting SAR operations should be expeditiously arranged to the best of each Party’s ability and 
via the appropriate RCCs.
3.8  Solely for the purpose of searching for the site of an accident, rescuing survivors of such accidents, 
rendering emergency rescue assistance to persons, vessels, or aircraft in danger or distress and when

the location is reasonably well known, permission to enter its territory shall be granted by a State to 
another State’s search and rescue unit(s), provided that a request has been transmitted to the rescue 
coordination centre of the concerned State or to such other authority as has been designated by the 
State.
3.9  The RCC of the State requesting assistance or the use of suitable SAR facilities of another State (“the

requesting RCC” and “the assisting State”, respectively), shall provide all pertinent details on the scope 
of the assistance or facilities required. The requesting RCC should provide a full briefing, directly 
or indirectly, to the SAR units that have been made available by the assisting State, on the scope of 
the mission before the SAR units enter the SRR of the requesting RCC. If it is necessary for the SAR

units of an assisting State to land at an airfield or to make use of the facilities of the requesting RCC 
in the course of performing an assigned SAR task, the RCC concerned should make all necessary 
arrangements to facilitate the taking of such measures or actions.
3.10  To facilitate the coordination referred to in this section, the Parties should, to the best of their ability, 
keep each other fully and promptly informed of all relevant SAR operations. The Parties should develop

appropriate procedures in accordance with the IAMSAR Manual to provide for the most effective and 
efficient means of communication.

Model agreement for the division of responsibility between the 
SAR Authority and the Air Traffic Services provider in providing 
emergency response services for aircraft
1 Purpose
1.1 The purpose of this document is to outline the division of responsibilities between the SAR Authority 
and Air Traffic Services (ATS) provider as component organizations contributing to the national

emergency response system for aircraft, and to propose a model arrangement for cooperation between 
the parties.
2 Background
2.1 The responsibility for the various aspects of the national emergency response system required under 
the Convention on International Civil Aviation may fall within two or more agencies of the national 
government. The SAR Authority has broad responsibilities under annex 12 for SAR response (and

ancillary functions are described in annexes 10 and 15) and the ATS provider has broad responsibilities 
under annex 11 for aviation SAR alerting. ATS also provides in-flight emergency response services for 
aircraft and assists Rescue Coordination Centres (RCCs) with their SAR response task by providing 
access to its aeronautical expertise and resources.
3 Duration and amendment
3.1 A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) may be in force for a period of five years from the date of

commencement and be extended for a further period or periods as agreed by the parties in accordance 
with the following principles:
(a) No variation is to be made to either the MoU or the agreed operational procedures dealing with 
in-flight emergencies or SAR alerting procedures without the consent of both parties.
(b) Where the parties agree to an alteration to this MoU, the alteration must be expressed in writing

and be ratified by the signatories of both parties to this MoU, with sufficient notice to allow 
adoption of any agreed amended practice.
4 Scope
4.1 This MoU and associated operational information contained in the associated procedures is designed 
to facilitate a system for effective operational interface, and to positively manage the transfer of 
operational responsibility, between the ATS provider and the RCC during aircraft emergency phases.

Appendix K – Model agreement for the division of responsibility
K-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
5.2 Such consultation should occur whenever either of the parties considers changes to the procedures 
to be appropriate to meet operational commitments, and at least once every 12 months from the 
commencement of this MoU.
6 Operational principles
6.1 The overriding principle governing the relationship of the agencies and the performance of activities

covered by this MoU is that the safety of life is paramount.
6.2 All services related to the MoU are to be provided in accordance with the agreed practices laid down 
in this MoU and the agreed operational procedures. Such services may include the provision of 
assistance to aircraft in distress in the State’s Search and Rescue Region (SRR).
6.3 When handling an aircraft emergency or responding to a SAR incident, there is a need for the RCC

and the ATS provider to work cooperatively and effectively together. It is important that there be no 
ambiguity with respect to the agency taking the lead and the agency providing support as an incident 
progresses. The lead agency role is determined by mutual agreement according to the division of 
responsibilities at paragraph 9.
7 Recorded operational information
7.1 RCCs may access information held by ATS units. For SAR purposes, ATS will provide the RCC, as soon as

practicable, all information relevant to a state of emergency of an aircraft, including copies of journals, 
flight plans, audio tape records, recorded radar data plots and all other relevant documentation.
7. 2 Both parties acknowledge that telephone conversations regarding operations or exercises between the 
two agencies may be recorded with or without prior warning.
8 Provision of information

8 Provision of information
8.1 Subject to their legal obligations relating to privacy and protection of commercial in-confidence 
information, each party agrees that the agencies will exchange information as necessary to successfully 
execute emergency response actions. Each agency shall use such information only for the purpose of 
properly meeting its legal obligations.
8.2 Each party agrees that, except as required to properly perform its statutory obligations, it will not

release information received by it from the other party without prior agreement.
9 Division of responsibilities
 Note:  Paragraphs 9.1 and 9.2 serve as an outline of ATS and RCC responsibilities that may be 
expanded upon by States to suit their individual circumstances.
9.1 In relation to the emergency response system, ATS will provide the following types of services:
(a) In-flight emergency response to provide assistance to a pilot to operate in safe airspace and land 
the aircraft safely.

Appendix K – Model agreement for the division of responsibility
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) K-3
9.2 In relation to the State aviation SAR and emergency response system, the RCC will provide the 
following types of services:
(a) Coordination of appropriate SAR response.
(b) Assistance to ATS with reference to relevant data.
(c) Coordination with ATS, when ATS is managing an in-flight emergency and RCC is managing a 
parallel SAR response to the incident.

Applying risk management principles to assess  
SAR response and SAR system performance
Risk management process
For the risk analysis to be effective it needs to take a broad view of the SAR system or response and, ideally, 
all stakeholders and interest groups should be involved. The process should be documented, noting that the 
value of the risk analysis is that it is an iterative process that, when repeated, provides valuable feedback on

risk mitigation effectiveness. The steps in the risk management process are shown at figure L-1, and provide a 
logical and systematic methodology for identifying, analysing, assessing, treating and monitoring risks.

Figure L-1 – The risk management process

Appendix L – Applying risk management principles to assess SAR response and SAR system performance
L-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
Establishing the context
The first step in the process is establishing the context in which the SAR risks will be determined. Will the 
analysis include the parts that other organizations, their resources and response plans play in assisting the SAR 
function? Will it make judgements on the complex national arrangements and their effectiveness if a major

SAR incident occurs? If this is the context that is being examined, there is a need to gain wide support for the 
analysis by promoting stakeholder involvement from appropriate decision makers outside the SAR organization.
If the context is internally focused, there may still be a need to make judgements about the external environment 
and the analysis may be able to determine priorities and the order in which they should be addressed. There

is also a need to understand the government policy framework in which the SAR organization exists and its 
funding basis. However, the risk process should put the question of limited funds being available aside until 
after the analysis is complete so that the outcomes are not distorted by self-imposed constraints before it has 
begun.
Identifying the risks
The second step in the process is identifying the risks, which is “the process of determining what can happen,

why and how” as the basis for further analysis. People have different risk perceptions and this step requires 
taking an objective view of current or potential situations where the objective of finding persons in distress 
and removing them to a place of safety may be compromised.
Some approaches used to identify risk include whether the risk is easily managed, if exposure is voluntary,

whether the risk is familiar, making an assessment that the situation may become catastrophic, the innate fear 
of the worst occurring, and personal or organizational win/loss assessments. The process can be based on 
formal analysis tools (e.g. quantitative analysis, Pareto analysis, systems engineering, etc.), where appropriate. 
However, in most circumstances for SAR it can be more simply accomplished by people that work in the

activity sitting down and coming to a collective view of the exposures facing the organization (e.g. experience, 
brainstorming, scenario analysis, lessons learned, etc.).
The subject matter could be discussed by using the divisions used in IAMSAR to break down the analysis. 
These are Organization and Management (volume I), Mission Coordination (volume II) and Mobile Facilities 
(volume III).
Analyse the risks

(volume III).
Analyse the risks
The third step in the process is to analyse the risks. This is done by establishing the cause of the risk, which 
is important when it comes to treating it, and determining its likelihood and consequences. Likelihood is a 
qualitative description of probability or frequency; and consequences are the outcome of an event, expressed 
qualitatively or quantitatively, expressed in terms of loss, injury, disadvantage or gain.

A common approach to document this interaction is to set values for likelihood and consequences of each 
risk. An example that may be useful in terms of determining likelihood for SAR is shown in table L-1.
Table L-1 – Qualitative measures of likelihood
Level Descriptor General description
A Almost certain daily occurrence
B Likely weekly occurrence
C Occasional monthly occurrence
D Possible yearly occurrence
E Unlikely 1 year < occurrence < 10 years
F Rare > 10 years

Appendix L – Applying risk management principles to assess SAR response and SAR system performance
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) L-3
The assignment of consequences is also done using general descriptions and an example is shown in table L-2. 
Caution needs to be exercised in assigning consequences, as every incident is not necessarily a potential 
major catastrophe. The history of SAR incidents and their outcomes over the last ten years is a good starting

point when approaching consequences.
Table L-2 – Qualitative measures of consequences or impact
Level Descriptor General description
1 Very low • routine or business management task with no 
life-saving consequence
• non-critical support role to other agency leading 
incident response
• staff have good SAR support tools available
• robust communications systems available
• excellent level of response assets available
2 Low • routine or business management task with potential

life-saving consequence
• lead role in non-SAR/safety of life activity
• staff have adequate SAR support tools
• fair communications systems available
• adequate level of first response assets available
3 Medium • routine or business management task with 
demonstrated life-saving consequence
• staff have inadequate SAR support tools
• poor communications systems available
• inadequate first response assets available
• a situation that may lead to an internal decision to

make a major change to procedures, structure or 
staffing
• fatality (1–5 people )
• hull loss 
4 High • a situation that may lead to an external decision to 
make major changes to structure or staffing at the 
management level
• fatality (6–14 people)
• hull loss 
5 Extreme • a political review of the SAR organization and its 
effectiveness
• fatality (>14 people)
• hull loss
Once the likelihood and consequence elements are determined, a risk analysis matrix is developed and tested

Appendix L – Applying risk management principles to assess SAR response and SAR system performance
L-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
Evaluate the risks
The fourth step in the process is to evaluate the risks. This is done by comparing likelihood against consequence, 
as shown at table L-3, and comparing the results with any previous risk analysis. The table L-3 comparison 
matrix will result in an ordering of risks and assist to develop an effective risk mitigation plan. An extreme risk

requires immediate remediation, a high risk requires urgent attention, a medium risk should be addressed as 
a priority, and a low-level risk can be addressed through routine processes.

D L L M H H

F L L L L M
Treat the risks

E L L L M H
F L L L L M
Treat the risks
The fifth step in the process is to treat the risks . In terms of SAR, it is important to minimize risk where it 
can be practically reduced on a cost/benefit basis. It may be possible to reduce low-level risk by introducing 
simple reduction measures such as additional staff training or SAR customer education. At the other end of 
the scale, it may not be possible to treat extreme risks due to inadequate resources or Government policy

decisions. However, the risk analysis process will prioritize these factors for the SAR Manager and it may be a 
powerful ally to assist in change management.
Monitor and review
The sixth step in the process is to monitor and review the performance of the risk management system and 
the changes that may affect it. Regular reviews (e.g. six-monthly) of the analysis should be conducted and the

effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies re-examined. Some risks may be transitory (e.g. contract renewals, 
changes to procedures, etc.) and others may be inherent in operating a SAR system. The iterative approach of 
the analysis means that SAR organizations will have a good understanding of the challenges facing them and 
will have considered approaches to remediate them. It may only be possible to alleviate some risks rather than 
removing them entirely.
Communicate and consult

removing them entirely.
Communicate and consult
The seventh and last step in the process is the most important, being communicate and consult. It is important 
to have a communications plan for stakeholders and involve them in the process. Industry peak representative 
bodies, if they exist, can be important stakeholders as they have a vested interest in the outcomes and may 
have the ability to influence higher level Government decision-making processes.

M.1.1 The Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) provides a basis for international 
cooperation between Contracting States in the provision of international civil aviation SAR services. 
The chapters, articles and annexes detail certain principles and arrangements in order that international

civil aviation services may be developed in a safe and orderly manner, international air transport 
established on the basis of equality of opportunity and all such services operated soundly and 
economically. These apply to international aviation operations but they also typically form the basis 
for national arrangements that only apply within the national territory (land and territorial sea). RCCs

should have procedures in place with their counterpart civil aviation authorities for advice regarding 
these aviation arrangements, if required.
M.1.2 The Convention Articles include the following:
 Articles specific to search and rescue and aircraft emergencies are as follows:
Articles 1 and 2 Airspace and Sovereignty;

M.1.4 It should be noted that the Chicago Convention does not provide any minimum response standards 
or sanctions in relation to the non-provision of aviation search and rescue services but relies on 
Contracting States to provide a level of service commensurate with their perceived requirements and

available resources. There is also an assumption that neighbouring countries will work together to 
achieve the common good.
M.2 Maritime arrangements
M.2.1 The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) is generally regarded as the most 
important of all international treaties concerning the safety of merchant ships. Its first version was 
adopted in 1914. Chapters with specific information relevant to SAR include:

Chapter I – General Provisions Part A discusses the application of the SOLAS Convention and 
provides some key definitions. Unless expressly provided otherwise within SOLAS, it applies only to 
ships engaged on international voyages. The classes of ships to which each chapter applies are more 
precisely defined in each chapter. The SOLAS Convention applies to ships and may not apply to the 
term “vessels” which has a different meaning under IMO regulations.

Chapter III – Life-saving appliances and arrangements discusses lifeboats, liferafts and rescue 
boats. Passenger ships and cargo ships often do not have the same requirements. Regulation 6, 
Communications, discusses SAR locating devices which may be carried on survival craft.
 Chapter IV – Radiocommunications  covers all forms of maritime communications (to include SAR 
alerting, coordinating, locating signals) and is the basis for IMO’s Global Maritime Distress and Safety

System (GMDSS). Part B is Undertakings by Contracting Governments and Part C is Ship requirements.
 Chapter V – Safety of Navigation, with certain exceptions listed, applies to all ships on all voyages. “All 
ships” is defined to mean any ship, vessel or craft irrespective of type and purpose. State vessels are 
one of the exceptions but it is a common practice by many States to have their ships meet the intent of

the SOLAS Convention. Regulation 2 defines search and rescue service. Other regulations of particular 
interest to SAR include regulation 7 Search and rescue services, regulation 19-1 Long-range identification 
and tracking of ships  (information is free of charge for SAR services of Contracting Governments), 
regulation 21, International Code of Signals and IAMSAR Manual, and regulation 33, Distress situations:

obligations and procedures (for the master of a ship at sea and also Contracting Governments).
 Chapter XIV – Safety measures for ships operating in polar waters makes mandatory the International 
Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (the Polar Code). The Polar Code requires the ship to have a 
Polar Water Operational Manual, and, its chapter 10 – Communication has information relevant to SAR.

M.2.2 The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979, known as the SAR Convention 
1979, is designed to provide a framework for carrying out search and rescue operations following 
accidents at sea.
M.2.3 The SAR Convention, as amended, clarifies the responsibilities of Governments and puts emphasis on 
the regional organizational approach and coordination between maritime and aeronautical operations.

M.2.4 Articles I to VIII of the SAR Convention discuss the general obligations of Parties under the Convention, 
and the obligations or rights of vessels provided for in other international instruments.
M.2.5 The chapters and resolutions that have a bearing on the management of emergency incidents involving 
persons in distress at sea include the following:
Chapter 1 Terms and definitions used;
Chapter 2 Organization and coordination of Search and Rescue services;

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) N-3
2.1.2 This section addresses procedures to be adopted in response to three main conditions:
.1 medical advice to ships;
.2 diversion of a ship to another port; and
.3 MEDEVAC.
2.1.3 When the TMAS receives a request for medical assistance it must:
.1 promptly undertake a remote medical assessment of the patient; and
.2 promptly provide appropriate medical advice to the ship’s master on the treatment to be

administered (generally by non-medical personnel).
2.1.4 Where the condition of the patient is such as to warrant more urgent and specialized care, the TMAS 
may also decide to make a recommendation to a ship’s master that:
.1 the patient should be landed urgently/as soon as possible to enable more expert treatment of the 
patient; or
.2 the patient should be evacuated immediately/as soon as possible to a land-based medical facility.
2.2 Medical advice to ships

2.2 Medical advice to ships
2.2.1 On receipt of a request for medical advice from a ship’s master, the TMAS will consult with the ship’s 
master as necessary and provide the appropriate medical advice.
2.2.2 Requests for medical advice received directly by, or on-passed to, the TMAS from ships do not require 
referring or reporting to the RCC unless evacuation is recommended.
2.2.3 In the event that the TMAS suspects that the medical problem may have border control implications:

.1 TMAS.  The TMAS must inform the RCC of the:
.1 name of the ship;
.2 name(s) of the affected person;
.3 medical condition; and
.4 probable port of arrival.
.2 The RCC.  The RCC must inform the appropriate border control agencies.
2.3 Diversion of a ship to port
2.3.1 In those cases where it is determined by the ship’s master, after medical consultation with the TMAS, 
that diversion to a port other than the next port of call is or may be necessary.

2.3.2 The TMAS must inform the RCC that diversion is or may be undertaken.
2.3.3 The RCC must, on request from the master of the ship, render necessary assistance to the master of 
the ship. This may include advice as to available ports and advising the ship’s agent, port, medical and 
border control authorities at the port of diversion.
2.4 MEDEVAC
2.4.1 The decision to MEDEVAC a patient is a matter for the ship’s master to decide on the basis of medical

advice that is provided by the TMAS. Consideration must be given to other factors, including the 
environmental conditions (weather, sea state, etc.) that may prevail at the time of possible extraction 
and the ship’s geographical location. The availability and type of recovery platform(s) may also affect 
the strategy or decision to MEDEVAC. Accordingly, close and ongoing consultation may be required

Appendix N – Sample contract between RCC and TMAS
N-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
2.4.2 Medical evacuations are generally undertaken by helicopter, possibly supported by a fixed wing 
aircraft. The TMAS must take into account that such evacuations can be carried out only when the 
ship is within helicopter’s flying range from land and only when a suitably equipped helicopter is 
available. It may be possible under conditions of extreme medical urgency for surface and air assets

to be used (ship as a staging landing platform plus helicopter); however, the availability of such assets 
cannot be assumed or guaranteed.
2.4.3 Where the ship’s master requires a MEDEVAC, and need of it is supported by the TMAS, the ship’s 
master may communicate with the RCC directly or through a maritime communications station 
without further reference to the TMAS. In this event the maritime communications station or the RCC 
will ascertain information which may include:

will ascertain information which may include:
.1 patient’s name and nationality;
.2 patient’s condition;
.3 master’s name and nationality;
.4 vessel name, flag and IMO Number;
.5 call sign;
.6 ship’s position;
.7 shipowner/operator and his country; and
.8 nearest port and ETA.
2.4.4 The RCC must:
.1 consult with the TMAS for medical advice that may affect:
.1 the type of rescue platform provided,
.2 any medical constraints or requirements that may affect the point and method of extraction,

.3 the recommended medical facility for delivery, and
.4 any other considerations that could affect the conduct of the MEDEVAC;
.2 source and task the surface and/or air asset(s) to be used as a recovery platform;
.3 advise the TMAS of the details of the recovery platform and the operating agency;
.4 advise the ship’s master of arrangements for the MEDEVAC, including rendezvous and any 
pre-arrangements for the extraction;

pre-arrangements for the extraction;
.5 advise the TMAS and the medical facility of the actual time of extraction and estimated time of 
delivery of the patient to the shore-based medical facility;
.6 facilitate the MEDEVAC as necessary and maintain a watch over the progress of the MEDEVAC 
until the patient is delivered to the medical facility; and
.7 notify the TMAS and the maritime communications station of the outcome of the MEDEVAC on 
completion of the event.
2.4.5 The TMAS must:

.3 consult with the operating agency/recovery platform to advise on the patient’s medical condition, 
any recommended constraints or requirements related to immediate treatment or processes of 
MEDEVAC and the proposed medical facility to receive the patient;
.4 continue to consult with the ship’s master regarding the patient’s condition as necessary in the 
circumstances;

circumstances;
.5 advise the medical facility of the medical status of the patient at the commencement of the 
MEDEVAC; and
.6 inform the RCC of any circumstances that may cause a need for change in the recovery platform 
type or timing including where the MEDEVAC is no longer deemed necessary.
3 Communications arrangements
3.1 General
3.1.1 The TMAS must maintain in operation at all times facilities for voice and data communications to

enable communication with the RCC, ships at sea and rescue personnel.  Those communications 
capabilities should include:
.1 voice communication;
.2 text messages;
.3 facsimile; and
.4 digital data transmission (photograph or electrocardiogram).
3.1.2 To support this communications capability, the TMAS must provide separate and dedicated phone 
and facsimile lines.
3.2 Communication between the TMAS and ships at sea

3.2.1 Ships seeking medical advice will normally be put in contact with one of the maritime communications 
stations. Calls will then either be transferred or relayed to the TMAS. Requests for advice may therefore 
come to the TMAS:
.1 directly from a ship via a transferred telephone call;
.2 via a maritime communications station which has received a request for assistance from a ship by:
.1 radiotelephony (RTF);
.2 radio telex;
.3 fax/phone;
.4 IMO-recognized mobile satellite service;

.4 IMO-recognized mobile satellite service;
.5 email; or
.6 via the RCC.
3.2.2 Requests for medical assistance passed to a maritime communications station will normally be 
relayed to the TMAS over the telephone and replies should be sent through the appropriate maritime 
communications station.
3.2.3 In some instances communications directly with a ship, for the provision of medical advice, may not 
be possible. In such circumstances, communications may need to be conducted through maritime

Appendix N – Sample contract between RCC and TMAS
N-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
3.2.4 Inmarsat communications
3.2.4.1 The various Inmarsat systems offer two abridged codes (special access codes – SAC) 32 and 38, which 
can be used for medical advice or medical assistance at sea through telephone, fax or telex using 
satellite communications.
.1 SAC 32 is used to obtain medical advice. The land earth station will provide a direct link with 
the TMAS when this code is used.

the TMAS when this code is used.
.2 SAC 38 is used when the condition of an injured or sick person on board a ship justifies medical 
assistance (evacuation to shore or services of a doctor on board). This code allows the call to be 
routed to the associated RCC.
3.3 Communication between the TMAS and the RCC
3.3.1 Communications between the TMAS and the RCC must be conducted by telephone or facsimile or 
the most appropriate and reliable telecommunication system.

TMAS contact details:   Telephone   Medical line 
General line
            Facsimile 
(Check with TMAS prior to  
transmission) 
Email
RCC contact details:    Telephone 
Alternate 
Facsimile 
Email
3.4 Communication between the State TMAS and a remote TMAS
3.4.1 Given the international dimension of maritime navigation, a medical problem may occur on board a 
ship very far from its country of origin. In such a case the master, who is responsible for the care of

those on board, normally calls his designated national TMAS, which can perform remote consultation 
in his language. Should there be need, following the remote consultation, for an evacuation to the 
nearest shore, the master will contact the RCC responsible for SAR operations in the search and 
rescue region (SRR) concerned. In order to facilitate and enhance the planning of the medical aspects

of the SAR operation involving medical assistance at sea, all available medical information collected 
by the TMAS that has carried out a remote consultation will be transferred to the TMAS attached to 
the responsible RCC. Everything must be done to avoid a second remote consultation by the second 
TMAS.
3.4.2 A common form for the exchange of medical information is available to facilitate the transfer of all

available and relevant medical information between the two TMAS authorities. See MSC/Circ.1218.
3.4.3 On the basis of trans-national partnership agreements, the “medical information exchange form” is 
used for SAR operations involving medical assistance at sea, in the following manner:
.1 when, following a remote consultation, a TMAS has indicated its recommendation to carry out 
a medical evacuation, the physician will complete the “medical information exchange form”;

.2 once the RCC responsible for the SAR operation has been identified, the remote TMAS will 
transmit the form to the corresponding partner TMAS of the RCC concerned;
.3 the RCC will be advised appropriately by its designated national TMAS of the medical constraints 
affecting the SAR operation;  and
.4 at the completion of the SAR operation, the operational TMAS will send any necessary information 
on medical follow-up to the TMAS that had performed the remote consultation.

Appendix N – Sample contract between RCC and TMAS
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) N-7
3.5 Recording and reporting of communications
3.5.1 Telemedical advice and assistance is subject to the confidentiality provision of the relevant Acts for 
the manner in which they are handled, stored and communicated.
3.5.2 In particular, telemedical advice must not be provided to third parties except for the delivery of the 
advice to:
.1 the target ship;
.2 the RCC;  and

advice to:
.1 the target ship;
.2 the RCC;  and
.3 paramedic organizations and medical institutions involved in the provision of the particular 
medical services to which the advice and assistance relates.
3.5.3 All TMAS communications must be identified by date and time and must be stored securely and so as 
to enable the records to be accessed promptly should they be required.
3.5.4 TMAS must fully document all communications including but not limited to:
.1 case notes;

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) O-1
Appendix O
Sample template for a joint search and rescue exercise
O.1 Objectives
  State the objectives of the joint SAREX and what participants want to achieve from it. SAREX can be in 
different formats; for example, Table Top SAREX which involves discussion and assists in understanding 
and testing of a plan, Simulation SAREX where simulators are used to create realism without physically

deploying assets, Live or Full Scale SAREX where there is actual deployment of assets to create realism 
in the testing of the plan, and Command Post SAREX where the decision-making process is tested.
 For example:
O.1.1 The objectives of the joint SAREX are:
(a) To provide improved search and rescue (SAR) cooperation between …………… (participating 
agencies or State RCC) and …………… (participating agencies or State RCC).

(b) To provide continuation training for personnel of SAR organizations from …………… (participating 
agencies or State RCC) and …………… (participating agencies or State RCC).
(c) To test the communication facilities and procedures between …………… (participating agencies 
or State RCC) and …………… (participating agencies or State RCC).
(d) To test and determine the effectiveness of the Search and Rescue Units (SRUs) of …………… 
(participating agencies).
O.2 Date and timing of SAREX

O.2 Date and timing of SAREX
  State the agreed date and time for the joint SAREX. Have alternate or contingency plans in the event 
that a full scale SAREX cannot be conducted due to bad weather or any unforeseen circumstances. It 
is recommended that a pre-SAREX brief be conducted to ensure all participants understand their roles 
and the required actions to be taken. State the agreed time for a pre-SAREX brief to be carried out for

all participants. States may conduct simultaneous pre-SAREX briefings at their own locations for their 
local participants. For standardization and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that all timing and 
dates used should be in UTC as there may be a difference in time and day for different States. After 
the SAREX, it is also recommended to conduct a de-brief for all participants.
 For example:

For example:
O.2.1 Table Top SAREX or A Full Scale Exercise will be held between …………… (participating agencies or 
State) and …………… (participating agencies or State) on …………… (day of the week, date/month/
year) from …………… (time in UTC) to …………… (time in UTC).
O.2.2 In the event of bad weather, the Full Scale SAREX will be converted into a Table Top SAREX. The cut 
off time will be at …………… (time in UTC).
O.2.3 A Pre-SAREX brief will be held on …………… (day of the week, day/month/year)  in ……………

Appendix O – Sample template for a joint search and rescue exercise
O-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
O.3 Scenario
  Discussion and development of exercise scenario with participating State or States and agencies 
involved. Scenario created should be as realistic as possible to simulate a real incident. A fictitious 
flight plan or ship’s passage plan can be included to provide additional information pertaining to the

distressed aircraft/ship. Using fictitious names and/or call signs for the distressed aircraft/ship and its 
airline/operator will avoid confusion on, for example, social media. Provide a fictitious manifest to 
indicate the number of people at risk.
 For example:
O.3.1 At …………… (time in UTC), a …………… (type of aircraft/ship) , …………… (name/call sign of 
distressed aircraft/ship), departed from …………… (point of departure) to …………… (destination)

with …………. (persons on board). At …………… (time in UTC), aircraft/ship declared “MAYDAY” 
due to …………… (nature of emergency) at ………….. (location in Lat and Long or with reference to 
a prominent location known to all). ……………………. (further details of the scenario, as required).
O.3.2 Other information, for example Pilot-in-command/Master’s actions, …………… equipment carried on 
board ……………, description of aircraft/ship, etc.
O.4 Participating Organizations

O.4 Participating Organizations
  Identify and list all participating agencies. As many responding agencies as possible should be 
included, both government and private. Air Navigation Service Provider, Aircraft Investigation Bureau, 
airlines, shipping companies, harbour authorities, etc. should be involved in a SAREX, as they would 
be directly involved in any real incident.
 For example:
O.4.1 From …………… (State: list participating local agencies, for example, RCC, Civil Aviation Authority,

Air Force, Navy, etc.)
1) …………………….
2) …………………….

 (Ship)      SAREX 05   Search and Rescue
 …………………….   SAREX….   …………………….
O.6 Communications
  State the agreed radio frequencies and other communications facilities to be used in the SAREX. List 
communication arrangements between the RCCs involved and between the RCCs and the SRUs and

other mobile SAR facilities. It is recommended that a communication check be conducted between 
all parties before the SAREX to ensure serviceability of communication equipment. A standby day 
may be necessary if the communication check is not satisfactory.
 For example:
O.6.1 The communications arrangement will be as follows:
(a) Between ……………………. (participating agency or State RCC) and ……………………. (other 
agencies or participating State RCC)

agencies or participating State RCC)
  Primary communication  (radio frequencies, telephone numbers, etc.)
  Secondary communication   – …………………….
  Standby communication   – …………………….
(b) Between ……………………. (State RCC and SRUs)
  Primary communication  – …..... kHz or …..... MHz
  Secondary communication  – …..... kHz or …..... MHz
  Standby communication  – …..... kHz or …..... MHz
O.6.2 A communication test between ……………………. (participating agency or State RCC) and

Appendix O – Sample template for a joint search and rescue exercise
O-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
O.6.4 All messages pertaining to the exercise shall be prefixed and ended with the words “EXERCISE 
EXERCISE EXERCISE”. Exercise participants must not use any internationally recognized Distress or 
Urgency Procedure words (for example, “MAYDAY”, “PAN-PAN”) on radio or telephone systems. 
Radio communications procedure words should be replaced as follows:

MAYDAY  – replace with “Mike Delta”
PAN-PAN  – replace with “Papa, Papa”
SÉCURITÉ   – replace with “Sierra, Sierra”
This will help to avoid confusion between a SAREX and an actual SAR incident.
O.7 Search object
In a Full Scale SAREX, States should consider the deployment of a search object (including a locator 
beacon) to add realism to the exercise. This will enable participating SRUs to practise visual and/or

electronic search techniques. The search object can be deployed at the proposed distress location 
at the SAREX start time. Search objects should be clearly marked as being deployed for exercise 
purposes.
 For example:
O.7.1 A …………… (description of the search object) will be provided by …………… (one of the participating 
agencies) and will be deployed at …………… (time in UTC) on …………… (date of the SAREX) at the 
distress position.

distress position.
O.7. 2 The search target is marked with …………… (for example, the word “SAREX”).
O.8 Alerting and activation
State clearly the alert and activation processes for the SAREX, including which agency will initiate 
the distress phase and how the other participating agencies will be notified. In a joint SAREX, if the 
distress location is within the area of responsibility of a particular State, the State concerned should 
initiate the alerting and activation phase.
 For example:

For example:
O.8.1 Since the distress location is within the area of responsibility of …………… (State), …………… (name) 
RCC will notify …………… (participating agencies) to initiate joint SAR operations.
O.9 Search area
Discuss how to determine the search area and which RCC will do so. In a joint SAR effort, the RCCs 
involved can determine their own search areas and agree an overall area.
 For example:

For example:
O.9.1 The respective SAR mission coordinators (SMCs) will work out a search area upon receipt of the 
distress location.
O.9.2 The SMCs shall discuss with each other and agree on a common search area.
O.9.3 If there is a great difference between the two search areas, the coordinating RCC shall decide on the 
most probable area and take the necessary action to promulgate the area as a restricted area for SAR 
operations accordingly.

Appendix O – Sample template for a joint search and rescue exercise
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) O-5
O.10 Diplomatic clearance
In a joint SAREX, make necessary arrangements for applying for diplomatic clearance if State assets 
may be or are required to enter another State’s territorial airspace or waters. The application process 
should be made known to all relevant participating agencies. If there is an agreement in place between

participating States, then the agreed procedure should be followed. Provide information regarding the 
SRUs and particulars of the personnel on board. It is recommended that particulars of the SRUs be 
provided to the State(s) concerned prior to the SAREX. This will assist in the diplomatic clearance 
process.
 For example:
O.10.1 …………… (State) RCC will send a request to …………… (State) for diplomatic clearance to allow 
…………… (State’s) SRUs to enter …………… (State’s) territorial airspace/waters.

O.10.2 To obtain diplomatic clearance the RCC shall provide the following particulars:
(a) unique identifier of the SRU as required by local authorities;
(b) type of aircraft or vessel;
(c) name of Pilot in Command/Master;
(d) names of crew on board (not required for sea asset);
(e) area of operation; and
(f) date and time of operation.
O.10.3 The details of the SRUs concerned shall be provided …………… (days/weeks) before the exercise.

Application for diplomatic clearances should be made through the normal channels in order to 
accelerate the diplomatic clearance process.
O.11 Search operations
Ensure the safe conduct of the SAREX, especially as regards the air assets. It is recommended that 
there should be one coordinating RCC providing instructions to SRUs prior to entering the search area. 
It is also recommended that an aircraft coordinator be deployed to provide instructions to aircraft

during transit to and from the search area as well as within the search area. Assign one of the SRUs as 
the on-scene coordinator, coordinating all the SAR facilities in the search area as well as providing an 
important communication link with the distressed aircraft/ship.
For example:
O.11.1 All SRUs shall report to the coordinating RCC or on-scene coordinator prior to entering the search 
area and while conducting SAR operations in the search area to ensure safety and efficiency in the

joint SAR effort. All aircraft involved must adhere to ATC instructions.
O.11.2 Non-exercise aircraft/surface vessels shall keep clear of the search area unless clearance has been 
obtained for them to transit through.
O.12 Rescue operations
Discuss how the rescue operation is to be executed. Live rescue operations provide training and 
testing opportunities. If personnel are deployed at the scene to simulate a rescue operation, it is

recommended to have a safety boat in the vicinity to ensure that the operation is closely monitored 
and all safety procedures are adhered to. Each SRU will report to the coordinating RCC or on-scene 
coordinator the number of survivors rescued and the state the survivors are in. This will assist in 
accounting for all at risk and whether immediate evacuation is required. If possible, recover the search

O-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
For example:
O.12.1 When the search object is sighted, the SRU shall inform the coordinating RCC. The RCC will 
disseminate the information to all other participants.
O.12.2 Recovery of the search object after the exercise will be undertaken by …………… (agency responsible 
for recovering the search object).

for recovering the search object).
O.12.3 If the search object cannot be recovered, urgent safety information broadcast action will be taken by 
…………… (agency responsible).
O.13 Emergency landing of participating aircraft
In a joint SAREX, make arrangements for participating aircraft to land in the event of an emergency.
For example:
O.13.1 …………… (State’s) aircraft participating in the SAREX will be given permission to land at ……………

(name of airport or airfield) if an emergency landing is required.
O.14 Termination or suspension of SAREX
State how and under what circumstances the SAREX will terminate. Make response arrangements in 
the event of a real incident occurring during the SAREX. Agree a code word or words which will be 
understood by all participating agencies and units. Once the code word is broadcast the SAREX will 
be converted into real SAR operations, at least for the duration of the real emergency.

For example:
O.14.1 The SAREX will be terminated when:
(a) all the Search and Rescue Units have returned to base; or
(b) the time for the SAREX has expired and no search object has been sighted.
The SAREX may be terminated or temporarily suspended when there is an actual emergency.
O.14.2 In the case of a real emergency, the exercise will be converted into a real SAR operation. The code 
words “NO DUFF NO DUFF” will be broadcast. All participating agencies and units will cease the

exercise immediately and await instructions from the coordinating RCC.
O.14.3 The exercise may be resumed when the real emergency has been resolved, if the participating 
agencies agree. Resumption of the exercise will be notified to all participants by the coordinating 
RCC. Alternatively the real emergency may require the exercise to be terminated.
O.15 SAREX de-brief
Conduct of a SAREX de-brief is important as this is where the evaluation process of the exercise is

presented by evaluation experts who observed the exercise, together with observations by people 
who actually participated in the exercise scenarios. This is the final step to identify weaknesses and 
good practices and development of recommendations for improvement. Agree on a date and venue 
to conduct a SAREX de-brief including all exercise participants.
For example:
O.15.1 SAREX de-brief will be held on …………… (day of the week, date/month/year)  commencing at 
…………… (time in UTC).

Appendix O – Sample template for a joint search and rescue exercise
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION) O-7
O.16 SAREX Controllers/Evaluators/Observers
Name the personnel who will be involved in the SAREX as observers, evaluators and exercise control-
lers. Evaluators and controllers in particular must have SAR expertise so that they will understand what 
is to be evaluated and how to control the exercise to maximize its value.
For example:

For example:
O.16.1 Personnel involved in the SAREX as exercise controllers, evaluators and observers will be as follows:
 …………… (Agency) …………… (name and role in the exercise)
 …………… (Agency) …………… (name and role in the exercise)
 …………… (Agency) …………… (name and role in the exercise)
O.17 Invitation to Observers
Agencies or States may consider inviting observers from other agencies or foreign countries or

international organizations to attend and observe the SAREX. These personnel can provide valuable 
feedback for improvement to the system. Agree which State will do the invitations and who should 
be invited to attend.
For example:
O.17.1 Invitations to observers to observe the SAREX will be provided by …………… (agency providing the 
invitation). Observers will be positioned at …………… (venue(s) for observation of the SAREX) and

will be escorted by officers of …………… (agency or agencies providing escorts).
O.17. 2 The following countries and organizations will be invited to attend:
(a) …………… (name of country or organization)
(b) …………… (name of country or organization)
(c) …………… (name of country or organization)
(d) …………… (name of country or organization)
O.18 News media coverage
If there is provision for news media coverage of the SAREX, agree the necessary arrangements (spokes-

people, drafting of press releases, etc.). During a SAREX, it is recommended that a joint information 
centre be set up as this will ease the burden on RCCs. Updates by RCCs are provided to one source 
thus ensuring the provision of timely, clear, accurate and consistent reports to the news media. This 
will provide a training opportunity in dissemination of information in a real incident.
For example:

For example:
O.18.1 Information updates will be provided by the RCC(s) to a Joint Information Centre for reports/updates/
press releases to the news media.
O.18.2 The Joint Information Centre will be established and staffed by the following agencies:
 …………… (name of agency)
 …………… (name of agency)
 …………… (name of agency)
O.18.3 If there is a requirement for a joint press release on the SAREX to be issued, …………… (agency that

Appendix O – Sample template for a joint search and rescue exercise
O-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME I (2022 EDITION)
O.19 SAREX report
A SAREX report is important as it will serve as a permanent record of the exercise. Each element of 
the exercise should be recorded and lessons learnt during the exercise captured. Agree who should 
produce the SAREX report for dissemination to all participating agencies and other interested parties.
For example:

For example:
O.19.1 (Insert Agency or State) will produce the SAREX report with assistance from …………… (the other 
participating agencies or State(s)). Photographs will be made available for the SAREX report.
O.19.2 A copy of the report will be sent to each of the following participating agencies, countries and 
international organizations.
(a) …………… (agency or country or international organization)
(b) …………… (agency or country or international organization)

(c) …………… (agency or country or international organization)
O.20 Venue for the next SAREX
It is good to plan for an annual joint SAREX with relevant agencies and/or neighbouring States. State 
the date and venue if possible for the next SAREX coordination meeting and the proposed SAREX 
type and date.
For example:
O.20.1 The next SAREX Coordination Meeting will be held at …………… (venue)  on …………… (date/
month/year).

The Organization and Management volume discusses the 
global search and rescue (SAR) system concept, estab-
lishment and improvement of national and regional SAR 
systems, and cooperation with neighbouring States to 
provide effective and economical SAR services.

Foreword
The primary purpose of the three volumes of the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue 
Manual (IAMSAR Manual) is to assist States in meeting their own search and rescue (SAR) needs, and the 
obligations they accepted under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the International Convention 
on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979 and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974

(SOLAS). These volumes provide guidelines for a common aviation and maritime approach to organizing and 
providing SAR services. States are encouraged to develop and improve their SAR services, cooperate with 
neighbouring States and to consider their SAR services to be part of a global SAR system.
Each volume of the IAMSAR Manual is written with specific SAR system duties in mind, and can be used as

a stand-alone document, or, in conjunction with the other two volumes, as a means to attain a full view of 
the SAR system. Depending on the duties assigned, it may be necessary to hold only one or two, or all three 
volumes.
The Organization and Management volume (volume I) discusses the global SAR system concept, establishment 
and improvement of national and regional SAR systems, and cooperation with neighbouring States to provide 
effective and economical SAR services;

effective and economical SAR services;
The Mission Coordination volume (volume II) assists personnel who plan and coordinate SAR operations and 
exercises; and
The Mobile Facilities volume (volume III) is intended to be carried aboard rescue units, aircraft and vessels to 
help with performance of a search, rescue, or on-scene coordinator function and with aspects of SAR that 
pertain to their own emergencies.
Mission Coordination

Mission Coordination
Chapter 1 presents an overview of the SAR system concept, including what is involved in providing SAR 
services, and why such services are required and beneficial. The SAR system is examined from a global, 
regional and national perspective. Key components of the SAR system, such as rescue coordination centres 
(RCCs), operational and support facilities and the on-scene coordinator (OSC), are discussed.

Chapter 2 focuses primarily on SAR communications topics. These include distress communications, 
emergency beacons, communications for SAR operations and a variety of communications and safety systems 
related to or used by the SAR system.
Chapter 3 introduces the five stages through which responses to SAR incidents typically progress, describes 
the three emergency phases (uncertainty, alert and distress) and the first two stages (awareness and initial

action) in detail, and provides additional valuable guidance for the early stages of a SAR incident.
Chapter 4 contains a detailed discussion of the theory and practice of search planning. It presents a complete 
yet practical application of search theory to the SAR search planning problem. It provides guidance for 
balancing the conflicting goals of covering large areas with limited facilities or using those facilities to achieve

high probabilities of detection in small areas. The procedures outlined allow the search planner to determine 
the optimal area to search so that the chances of success are maximized.
Chapter 5 discusses search techniques and operations, including search facility selection, assessment of search 
conditions, search pattern selection for visual, electronic, night and land searches, search sub-area assignments,

standard methods for designating and describing search sub-areas, planning of on-scene coordination, and 
finally compiling all this data into an attainable search action plan.

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 1-1
Chapter 1
The search and rescue system
1.1 System organization
 Global SAR system organization
1.1.1 The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) coordinate, on a global basis, member States’ efforts to provide search and rescue (SAR) 
services. Briefly, the goal of ICAO and IMO is to provide an effective worldwide system, so that

wherever people may be in danger, in the air or at sea, SAR services will be available if needed. The 
overall approach a State takes in establishing, providing, and improving SAR services is affected by 
the fact that these efforts are an integral part of a global SAR system.
1.1.2 A basic, practical, and humanitarian effect of having a global SAR system is that it eliminates the need 
for each State to provide SAR services for its own citizens wherever they travel worldwide. Instead,

the globe is divided into search and rescue regions (SRRs), each with a rescue coordination centre 
(RCC) and associated SAR services, which assist anyone in distress within the SRR without regard to 
nationality or circumstances.
 National and regional SAR system organization
1.1.3 States, by being Party to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, the International Convention 
on Maritime Search and Rescue , and the Convention on International Civil Aviation , have accepted

the obligation to provide aeronautical and maritime SAR coordination and services for their territories, 
territorial seas, and, where appropriate, the high seas. SAR services are to be available on a 24-hour basis.
1.1.4 To carry out these responsibilities, a State either should establish a national SAR organization, or join one 
or more other States to form a regional SAR organization. In some areas an effective and practical way

to achieve this goal is to develop a regional system associated with a major ocean area and continent.
1.1.5 ICAO Regional Air Navigation Plans (RANPs) depict aeronautical SRRs for most of the world. Many 
States are given an area of responsibility which is usually composed of one aeronautical SRR. Maritime 
SRRs are published in the IMO SAR Plan, and are similar, but not necessarily identical, to aeronautical

SRRs. The purpose of having SRRs is to clearly define who has primary responsibility for coordinating 
responses to distress situations in every area of the world, which is especially important for automatic 
routeing of distress alerts to responsible RCCs.
1.2 SAR coordination
1.2.1 The SAR system has three levels of coordination associated with SAR coordinators (SCs), SAR mission 
coordinators (SMCs), and on-scene coordinators (OSCs).

1.2.2 SAR coordinators. SCs have the overall responsibility for establishing, staffing, equipping, and managing 
the SAR system, including providing appropriate legal and funding support, establishing RCCs and 
rescue sub-centres (RSCs), providing or arranging for SAR facilities, coordinating SAR training, and 
developing SAR policies. SCs are the top level SAR managers; each State normally will have one or

more persons or agencies for whom this designation may be appropriate. More information on SAR 
management responsibilities may be found in the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and 
Rescue Manual on Organization and Management. SCs are not normally involved in the conduct of 
SAR operations.

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
1-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
1.2.3 SAR operations are normally carried out under the direction and supervision of an SMC, who is 
usually the supervisor of the RCC or RSC watch team. In multiple-incident situations this officer could 
be SMC for all incidents, or, for some of those incidents, the SMC role could be delegated to another 
suitably qualified member of the watch team. The SMC should in all cases be supported by RCC

watch team members to undertake functions in the coordinating process such as communications, 
plotting, logging and search planning. For complex cases or those of long duration, the assisting team 
as well as the SMC must be replaced at regular intervals. The SMC must be able to competently 
gather information about emergencies, transform emergency incident information into accurate and 
workable plans and dispatch and coordinate the facilities which will carry out the SAR missions.

(a) The SMC is in charge of a SAR operation until a rescue has been effected or until it has become 
apparent that further efforts would be of no avail, or until responsibility is accepted by another 
RCC. The SMC should be able to use readily available facilities and to request additional ones 
during the operation. The SMC plans the search and rescue operations and coordinates the 
transit of SAR facilities to and from the scene.

transit of SAR facilities to and from the scene.
(b) The SMC should be well trained in all SAR processes and be thoroughly familiar with the 
applicable SAR plans. The SMC must competently gather information about distress situations, 
develop accurate and workable action plans, and dispatch and coordinate the resources which 
will carry out SAR missions. The plans of operation maintained by the RCC provide information 
to assist in these efforts. Guidelines for SMC duties include:

– obtain and evaluate all data on the emergency;
 – ascertain the type of emergency equipment carried by the missing or distressed craft;
 – remain informed of prevailing environmental conditions;
 – if necessary, ascertain movements and location of vessels and alert shipping in likely 
search areas for rescue, lookout (visual and electronic) and/or radio watch on appropriate 
frequencies to facilitate communications with SAR facilities;

– plot the area to be searched and decide on the methods and facilities to be used;
 – develop the search action plan (and rescue action plan as appropriate), i.e. allocate search 
areas, designate the OSC, dispatch SAR facilities and designate on-scene communications 
frequencies;
 – inform the RCC chief of the search action plan;
 – coordinate the operation with adjacent RCCs when appropriate;
 – arrange briefing and debriefing of SAR personnel;

– evaluate all reports from any source and modify the search action plan as necessary;
 – arrange for the fuelling of aircraft and, if necessary, rescue vessels and, for prolonged 
search, make arrangements for the accommodation of SAR personnel;
 – arrange for delivery of supplies to sustain survivors;
 – maintain in chronological order an accurate and up-to-date record with a plot, where 
necessary, of all proceedings;
 – issue progress reports;

– issue progress reports;
 – recommend to the RCC chief the abandoning or suspending of the search;
 – release SAR facilities when assistance is no longer required;
 – notify accident investigation authorities;
 – notify police and other government authorities where relevant and necessary;
 – if applicable, notify the State of registry of the aircraft or vessel in accordance with 
established arrangements; and
 – prepare a final report on the results of the operation.

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 1-3
1.2.4 On-scene coordinator. When two or more SAR units are working together on the same mission, there 
is sometimes an advantage if one person is assigned to coordinate the activities of all participating 
units. The SMC designates this on-scene coordinator (OSC), who may be the person in charge of a 
search and rescue unit (SRU), ship or aircraft participating in a search, or someone at another nearby

facility in a position to handle OSC duties. The person in charge of the first SAR facility to arrive at 
the scene will normally assume the function of OSC until the SMC directs that the person be relieved. 
The OSC may have to assume SMC duties and actually plan the search and/or rescue if the OSC 
becomes aware of a distress situation directly and communications cannot be established with an 
RCC. The OSC should be the most capable person available, taking into consideration SAR training,

communications capabilities, and the length of time that the unit the OSC is aboard can stay in the 
search area. Frequent changes in the OSC should be avoided. Duties which the SMC may assign to 
the OSC, depending on needs and qualification, include any of the following:
 – assume operational coordination of all SAR facilities on scene;
 – receive the search and/or rescue action plan from the SMC;
 – modify the action plan based on prevailing environmental conditions and keep the SMC advised

of any changes to the plan (discuss proposed modifications with the SMC when practicable);
 – provide relevant information to the other SAR facilities;
 – implement the action plan;
 – monitor the performance of other units participating in the operation; and
 – make consolidated reports (SITREPs) to the SMC.
1.2.5 Aircraft coordinator The purpose of the aircraft coordinator (ACO) function is to maintain high flight

safety and cooperate in the rescue action to make it more effective. The ACO function should be seen 
as a cooperating, supporting and advisory service. The ACO should normally be designated by the 
SMC, or if that is not practicable, by the OSC. The ACO function will normally be performed by the 
facility with the most suitable mix of communication means, radar, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite

System) combined with trained personnel to effectively coordinate the involvement of multiple aircraft 
in SAR operations while maintaining flight safety. Generally the ACO is responsible to the SMC; 
however, the ACO work on scene must be coordinated closely with the OSC, and if no SMC or OSC, 
as the case may be, the ACO would remain in overall charge of operations. Duties of the ACO can 
be carried out from a fixed-wing aircraft, helicopter, ship, a fixed structure such as an oil rig, or an

appropriate land unit, such as an ATS unit or RCC. Depending on needs and qualifications, the ACO 
may be assigned duties that include the following:
 – coordinate the airborne resources in a defined geographical area;
 – assist in maintaining flight safety by issuing safety-related information;
 – practise flow planning (example: point of entry and point of exit);
 – prioritize and allocate tasks;
 – coordinate the coverage of search areas;
 – forward radio messages (can be the only duty);

– forward radio messages (can be the only duty);
 – make consolidated situation reports (SITREPs) to the SMC and the OSC, as appropriate; and 
work closely with the OSC; and
 – it is important that the ACO is aware of the fact that the participating airborne units, if possible, 
try to avoid disturbing other participating units with, for example, noise and rotor wind.

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
1-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
1.2.6 Airborne SRUs should make a standard joining entry report to the ACO when entering a search and 
rescue mission area, including:
 – call sign;
 – nationality;
 – type (specify fixed-wing or helicopter and type);
 – position;
 – altitude (on pressure setting used);
 – ETA (at relevant point or search area);
 – endurance on scene; and
 – remarks (specific equipment or limitations).
1.3 SAR resources

1.3 SAR resources
1.3.1 The SAR organization includes all of those agencies which perform distress monitoring, communications, 
coordination, and response functions. This includes providing or arranging for medical advice, initial 
medical assistance, or medical evacuation, if necessary. SAR facilities consist of all of the public and 
private facilities, including cooperating aircraft, vessels, other craft and installations operating under

coordination of an RCC. In establishing a SAR service, States should use existing facilities to the fullest 
extent possible. A successful SAR organization usually can be created without having designated, 
full-time SRUs.
1.3.2 A list of potential SAR resources is contained in IAMSAR Manual, volume I, Organization and 
Management.
1.3.3 International resources. Several resources exist internationally which can be used by RCCs while

coordinating a specific SAR mission. Examples of such resources available for use by all RCCs are 
discussed in the following paragraphs.
 Ship reporting systems and vessel tracking
1.3.4 Vessels at sea, although not always available to participate in extended search operations, are potential 
aeronautical and maritime SAR assets. Masters of vessels have a duty to assist others whenever it 
can be done without endangering the assisting vessel or crew. Various States have implemented

ship reporting systems. A ship reporting system enables the SMC to quickly know the approximate 
positions, courses, and speeds of vessels in the vicinity of a distress situation by means of a surface 
picture (SURPIC), and other information about the vessels which may be valuable, e.g. whether a 
doctor is aboard. Masters of vessels should be encouraged to send regular reports to the authority 
operating a ship reporting system for SAR. Ships are a key SAR resource for RCCs, but requests for

them to assist must be weighed against the considerable cost to shipping companies when they do 
divert to assist. Ship reporting systems enable RCCs to quickly identify the capable vessel which will 
be least harmed by a diversion, enabling other vessels in the vicinity to be unaffected.
1.3.5 The Amver system, the only worldwide system operated exclusively to support SAR, makes information 
available to all RCCs. Any United States RCC can be contacted for this type of SAR information.

Appendix O lists many of the ship reporting systems established for SAR, and will be updated as more 
information becomes available.
1.3.6 As well as ship reporting systems (SRS), RCCs can use vessel position data from various vessel tracking 
systems to support SAR operations. These may include the long-range identification and tracking 
(LRIT) system, the automatic identification system (AIS) system, fisheries and other vessel monitoring

systems (VMS) and vessel traffic services (VTS) established to monitor port operations or to cover 
focal areas or sensitive areas. Data from each of these systems can be displayed by RCCs using 
geographic information systems (GIS) to produce a surface picture (SURPIC). SURPICs can be used

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 1-5
to identify and locate potential rescue vessels as well as improve maritime domain awareness (MDA). 
In accordance with SOLAS regulation V/19-1, Contracting Governments should make provision to 
receive LRIT vessel position data for SAR.  In accordance with IMO guidance material, RCCs can 
request LRIT data for SAR operations within their own SRR and for SAR coordination requirements

outside it, as appropriate. Data on all vessels can be requested within a circular or rectangular area at 
no charge to the RCC.
 Global Maritime Distress and Safety System
1.3.7 Ships subject to the SOLAS Convention should be outfitted with certain communications equipment, 
collectively referred to as the shipboard portion of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System 
(GMDSS). Certain fishing vessels and other marine craft also may be obligated to carry GMDSS-

compatible equipment, or may do so voluntarily. GMDSS is intended to provide automatic alerting 
and locating with minimal delay, a reliable network for SAR communications, integration of satellite 
and terrestrial communications, and adequate frequencies in all maritime bands.
1.3.8 RCC personnel should be familiar with the SOLAS GMDSS provisions, and associated IMO documents. 
The general goal of GMDSS is to take advantage of available technology to shift alerting emphasis

from ship to ship (though this is still done), towards ship to shore, so that SAR professionals are rapidly 
alerted and can help arrange assistance. GMDSS capabilities of vessels not subject to SOLAS may 
range from full compliance to no GMDSS capabilities at all.
1.3.9 Introduction of GMDSS aboard only some vessels adds capabilities for those vessels, but also 
introduces incompatibility between those vessels and vessels not GMDSS equipped. It also introduces

the need for some SAR authorities to support two maritime mobile and fixed systems. An initial goal of 
GMDSS was to eliminate the need for a continuous listening watch on VHF-FM channel 16. However, 
since most other vessels depend on channel 16 for distress, safety, and calling, IMO has decided that 
all GMDSS ships, while at sea, shall continue to maintain, when practicable, continuous listening 
watch on VHF-FM channel 16.
 Aeronautical systems

1.3.10  The Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS) was established to mitigate challenges 
in the global air navigation system, regarding the timely identification and localization of aircraft in 
distress. GADSS provides an effective and globally consistent approach to enhancing the alerting 
procedures of search and rescue services by addressing a number of key improvement areas.
1.3.11  GADSS has three main elements:

1.3.11  GADSS has three main elements:
 – aircraft tracking (typically between the ATS unit and the aircraft operator);
 – location of an aircraft in distress (achieved through autonomous distress tracking (ADT) of aircraft 
in flight); and
 – post-flight localization and recovery.
1.3.12 GADSS ensures an up-to-date record of aircraft progress is maintained and, in case of a crash, forced 
landing or ditching, ensures information on the location of survivors, the aircraft and recoverable

flight data is available. For GADSS to function as intended, flight crew and aircraft operators, air traffic 
controllers and air navigation services providers, ADT service providers, and rescue coordination 
centres (RCCs) need to understand each other’s roles, responsibilities and processes to ensure effective 
communication, robust coordination and harmonized implementation across the globe.

1.3.13  For aircraft tracking in GADSS, the aircraft operator is required to establish an aircraft tracking capability 
throughout its area of operations. Such tracking is required in oceanic areas (airspace which overlies 
waters outside of the territory and territorial sea of a State) and recommended in all areas of operations. 
Tracking is accomplished through automated four-dimensional (latitude, longitude, altitude and time)

position reports transmitted at an interval of 15 minutes or less, unless ATS surveillance obtains aircraft 
position information at 15-minute intervals or less.

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
1-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
1.3.14  The aircraft tracking element enhances the ability of RCCs to obtain information on an aircraft in an 
emergency situation but also to provide information on other aircraft in the area that may be able 
to assist, for example, to divert to a distress location, relay communications, etc. However, aircraft 
tracking responsibilities and actions are typically performed between the ATS unit and the aircraft

operator.
1.3.15  The location of an aircraft in distress (achieved through autonomous distress tracking (ADT) of aircraft 
in flight) element has the greatest potential impact upon aeronautical and maritime SAR services.
1.3.16  The standard defining location of an aircraft in distress requires that, as of 1 January 2023, aircraft 
issued with a certificate of airworthiness for the first time, with a maximum certificated take-off

mass of over 27 ,000 kg, “shall autonomously transmit information from which a position can be 
determined by the operator at least once every minute, when in distress.” The ICAO provisions also 
recommend that this requirement be applied to aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass of 
over 5,700 kg.
1.3.17  More detailed information on responsibilities and procedures regarding ADT and aspects of post-flight

localization and recovery is provided in appendix V, Autonomous distress tracking of aircraft in flight.
1.3.18  Aircraft post-flight localization and recovery is improved by standards on aircraft carriage of 
underwater locating devices (ULD). This is intended more for the recovery of flight recorder data by 
the aeronautical accident investigators. SAR services should be aware that detecting the ULD is not

an SAR responsibility or task. Two types of ULD are in use, which assist in locating wreckage below 
the surface of water where it is not possible to detect an ELT signal.
1.4 Medical assistance to vessels
1.4.1 The SMC should have procedures in place for responding to a request for medical advice at sea 
(MEDICO) and for medical evacuation.
1.4.2 MEDICO is an international term usually meaning the passing of medical information by radio.

SAR agencies may provide medical advice either with their own doctors, or by arrangements with 
a telemedical assistance service (TMAS). (Such doctors should be trained, if possible, regarding the 
inherent risks associated with medical emergencies at sea and with medical evacuations, so that these 
factors can be considered in recommendations for treatment or evacuation.) There are organizations

in some States which provide subscription and pay-per-use medical advice to vessels at sea. However, 
perhaps the best known TMAS is Centro Internazionale Radio-Medico (CIRM) in Rome, Italy. 
Section 2.28 provides some additional information. SMCs who hand off medical advice duties to 
another organization should monitor the situations, since they sometimes involve medical evacuations.
1.4.3 The ITU’s List of Radiodetermination and Special Service Stations lists commercial and Government

radio stations which provide free medical message service to ships. These incoming or outgoing 
messages should be prefixed with “DH MEDICO”. Messages requesting medical advice are normally 
delivered to RCCs, hospitals or other facilities in accordance with prior arrangements.
1.4.4 Medical evacuation can be extremely hazardous to the patient and to the crews of the vessel and 
SRU, because of environmental conditions and dangers inherent in transferring a patient from a vessel

to another vessel or helicopter. If the medical personnel consulted do not fully understand the risks, 
the SMC should explain the risks and ask for an opinion on the urgency of the medical situation and 
the necessity of and priority for evacuation. The SMC should obtain advice from medical personnel 
who understand these risks before deciding to carry out an evacuation. The final decision about

whether it is safe to conduct an evacuation rests with the master or pilot in command of the rescue 
facility tasked with the evacuation. The risks of the evacuation must be measured against the risks to 
the patient and the SAR facility. Factors to consider include:
 – medical capabilities of the SAR facility;
 – weather, sea, and other environmental conditions;
 – agreements between vessels and hospitals or commercial medical advisory services;
 – the patient’s clinical status; and

– the patient’s clinical status; and
 – the patient’s probable clinical course if evacuation is delayed or not performed. A delayed 
evacuation, if the patient’s condition permits, may:
 – provide for adequate planning by the SMC;
 – allow the SAR facility to remain within its range limits;
 – enable a daylight evacuation;
 – allow the vessel to enter port; or
 – allow the weather to improve.
1.4.5 Appendix D, MEDICO or MEDEVAC checklist provides additional information, including guidance

when full medical consultation may not be available.
1.5 Plans of operation
1.5.1 Each RCC should prepare comprehensive plans of operation for its SRR, and take into account 
agreements with providers of facilities or other support for SAR operations. The plans of operation 
should be brought up to date whenever a change in conditions or experience in actual operations and 
exercises makes this necessary or advisable.

exercises makes this necessary or advisable.
1.5.2 The location of the RCC and the description of its area of responsibility should be published in 
a national document (e.g. the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) and annual Notices to 
Mariners). The plans of operation should include information on the following general categories:
 – procedures for SAR coordination and types of SAR operations;
 – responsibilities of personnel assigned to SAR operations;
 – facilities;

– facilities;
 – communications;
 – operational information; and
 – training and discussion.
1.6 SAR operations stages
1.6.1 The success of a SAR mission often depends on the speed with which the operation is planned and 
carried out. The prompt receipt of all available information by the RCC is necessary for thorough 
evaluation of the situation, immediate decision on the best course of action, and a timely activation

of SAR facilities. While no two SAR operations follow exactly the same pattern, SAR incidents do 
generally pass through defined stages, which can be used to help organize response activities. These 
stages are discussed in general terms below and expanded discussion is found in the remaining 
chapters of this volume. These stages should be interpreted with flexibility, as many of the actions 
described may be performed simultaneously or in a different order to suit specific circumstances.

Awareness stage
1.6.2 The SAR organization cannot respond to an incident until it becomes aware that people or craft need 
assistance. Therefore, the general public should be encouraged to report any abnormal occurrence 
which they have heard about or witnessed. SAR authorities must ensure that notification that an aircraft 
has crashed, or that an aircraft, ship, other craft or person(s) is overdue or in a state of emergency, can

reach an RCC from any source, either directly or via an alerting post.
1.6.3 ATS units receive information on most commercial aircraft flights and are periodically in contact 
with the aircraft. An aircraft emergency therefore is likely to come to ATS attention first. An RCC will 
usually be notified by an ATS unit when an aircraft is, or may be, in a state of emergency. However, 
notification of a general aviation aircraft emergency may often come from a local airport, a concerned

individual reporting it overdue or witnesses seeing an aircraft in difficulty or crash. When the nature

 – the patient’s clinical status; and
 – the patient’s probable clinical course if evacuation is delayed or not performed. A delayed 
evacuation, if the patient’s condition permits, may:
 – provide for adequate planning by the SMC;
 – allow the SAR facility to remain within its range limits;
 – enable a daylight evacuation;
 – allow the vessel to enter port; or
 – allow the weather to improve.

– allow the weather to improve.

when full medical consultation may not be available.
1.5 Plans of operation
1.5.1 Each RCC should prepare comprehensive plans of operation for its SRR, and take into account 
agreements with providers of facilities or other support for SAR operations. The plans of operation

should be brought up to date whenever a change in conditions or experience in actual operations and 
exercises makes this necessary or advisable.
1.5.2 The location of the RCC and the description of its area of responsibility should be published in 
a national document (e.g. the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) and annual Notices to 
Mariners). The plans of operation should include information on the following general categories:

– procedures for SAR coordination and types of SAR operations;
 – responsibilities of personnel assigned to SAR operations;
 – facilities;
 – communications;
 – operational information; and
 – training and discussion.
1.6 SAR operations stages
1.6.1 The success of a SAR mission often depends on the speed with which the operation is planned and 
carried out. The prompt receipt of all available information by the RCC is necessary for thorough

evaluation of the situation, immediate decision on the best course of action, and a timely activation 
of SAR facilities. While no two SAR operations follow exactly the same pattern, SAR incidents do

stages are discussed in general terms below and expanded discussion is found in the remaining 
chapters of this volume. These stages should be interpreted with flexibility, as many of the actions

described may be performed simultaneously or in a different order to suit specific circumstances.
 Awareness stage
1.6.2 The SAR organization cannot respond to an incident until it becomes aware that people or craft need 
assistance. Therefore, the general public should be encouraged to report any abnormal occurrence 
which they have heard about or witnessed. SAR authorities must ensure that notification that an aircraft

has crashed, or that an aircraft, ship, other craft or person(s) is overdue or in a state of emergency, can 
reach an RCC from any source, either directly or via an alerting post.
1.6.3 ATS units receive information on most commercial aircraft flights and are periodically in contact 
with the aircraft. An aircraft emergency therefore is likely to come to ATS attention first. An RCC will 
usually be notified by an ATS unit when an aircraft is, or may be, in a state of emergency. However,

notification of a general aviation aircraft emergency may often come from a local airport, a concerned 
individual reporting it overdue or witnesses seeing an aircraft in difficulty or crash. When the nature

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
1-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
of the emergency is such that local rescue facilities can handle the emergency, e.g. when an incident 
occurs at or near an aerodrome, the RCC will not always be informed.
1.6.4 In some areas, a coast radio station (CRS) provides the main link for ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship 
communications and, in this situation, it may be that the CRS usually receives the first information

that a ship or other craft on the water is in distress. A CRS is required by international regulations to 
relay this information to SAR authorities. As a result, an RCC will often receive first notification that a 
ship or other craft is in distress from a CRS with which it is associated, or via its own communications 
facilities. Some RCCs may have radio or satellite communications capability that enables them to be 
alerted directly.

alerted directly.
1.6.5 The RCC must keep a complete record of information it receives. Pre-printed forms often are used 
to ensure that full information about the SAR incident is obtained and remains available for review. 
Chapter 3 discusses these topics.
 Initial action
1.6.6 Once an RCC receives an initial report about persons or craft in distress, some immediate action often 
is appropriate pending receipt and evaluation of more complete information. RCCs usually have in

their plans of operation a checklist of steps to accomplish for each type of incident with which the 
RCC expects that it may become involved.
1.6.7 After evaluating all available information and taking into account the degree of emergency, the SMC 
should declare the appropriate emergency phase and immediately inform all appropriate centres, 
personnel and facilities. Three emergency phases have been established for classifying incidents and

to help in determining the actions to be taken for each incident. These are:
 – uncertainty phase;
 – alert phase; and
 – distress phase.
1.6.8 The response to the emergency will depend on many factors, including the nature of the emergency, 
on-scene conditions, the number of people at risk and their likely survival times, and the capability 
of available SAR facilities. The SMC should assess the information available and, consulting with the

commander of the craft in difficulty if possible and other responders as appropriate, determine the 
best course of action.
1.6.9 Having assessed the situation and decided an initial course of action, the SMC should communicate 
it efficiently to all responders and, if possible, to those at risk.
1.6.10 Depending on how the situation develops, the incident may have to be reclassified and/or response

action changed. See chapter 3 for a complete discussion of initial action stage and emergency phases 
of a SAR incident. Emergency phases are only intended to be declared by an RCC, an RSC, or an ATS 
unit.
1.6.11 Particularly for overdue craft, evaluation is a crucial function that the SMC performs during a SAR 
incident. All reports received before and during a SAR operation must be carefully evaluated to determine

their validity, the urgency for action, and the extent of the response required. Chapter 4 discusses this 
process in detail. While evaluation of reports may be difficult and time-consuming, decisions must be 
made and action taken as quickly as possible. If uncertain information cannot be confirmed without 
undue delay, the SMC should act on a questionable message rather than wait for verification.
 Planning stage

Planning stage
1.6.12 Comprehensive planning of SAR response tasks is essential, especially when the location of the distress 
situation is unknown and the survivors may move, for example, due to wind and water currents or by 
attempting to walk out of a remote land area. Proper and accurate planning is critical to SAR mission 
success; if the wrong area is searched, there is no hope that search personnel will find the survivors,

regardless of the quality of their search techniques or the amount of their search effort. This requires 
proper training of the SMC and other RCC personnel. Computers can eliminate much of the detailed 
work in search planning, and can improve accuracy. Since not all States have access to computerized 
search planning, Chapter 4 of this volume contains the basic information on how to plan searches 
using manual methods. A rescue action plan is also required.
 Operations stage

Operations stage
1.6.13 The SAR operations stage encompasses all activities that involve searching for the distressed persons 
or craft, providing assistance, and delivering them to a place of safety. In this stage, the SMC assumes 
a monitoring and guidance role, ensuring that the search and rescue plans are received, understood, 
and followed by SAR facilities. They may also continue to gather or receive more information and

assess this to see if it affects or changes any of the plans previously made. The RCC may also be the 
focal point for communications with other organizations. The RCC staff usually will spend most of 
this stage planning subsequent searches, based on updated information and the assumption that the 
present search will be unsuccessful. See chapter 5 for a discussion of search operations; see chapter 6 
for guidance on rescue operations.
 Conclusion stage

Conclusion stage
1.6.14 SAR operations enter the conclusion stage when:
 – information is received that the aircraft, ship, other craft or persons who are the subject of the 
SAR incident are not in distress; or
 – the aircraft, ship or persons for whom SAR facilities are searching have been located and the 
survivors rescued; or
 – during the distress phase, the SMC determines that further search would be to no avail because

additional effort cannot appreciably increase the probability of successfully finding any remaining 
survivors or because there is no longer any reasonable probability that the persons in distress 
have survived.
1.6.15 When SAR operations are terminated, all authorities, facilities, or services which have been activated 
must be immediately notified, as discussed in chapter 9.
1.7 Mission documentation

1.7 Mission documentation
1.7.1 The RCC must record all information about each SAR incident as it is received, either in full or by 
reference to other permanent records such as separate reports, forms, folders, charts, telegrams, 
recorded radio frequencies and telephones, recorded radar data, etc. The form that this record keeping 
takes is not important so long as it is logically organized for easy retrieval. Sufficient information must be

recorded and retained to completely re-create the case and show the rationale for all decisions taken.
 Logs and diaries
1.7. 2 The initial notification of an incident should be entered on a standard Incident Processing Form, 
supplies of which should be available at RCCs, RSCs, ATS units, and other alerting posts, as necessary.  
This form is needed to ensure that all available information on important details is obtained at first

contact since it may be impossible or too time-consuming to obtain such information at a later stage. 
Use of an Incident Processing Form will ensure that all important details are elicited from the informant. 
This is particularly important if the informant is not experienced in maritime or aviation activities. The 
informant may be excited and under stress when making the report. The list is comprehensive and

includes both the occupation and address of the informant as this information may help in assessment 
of the reliability of the report and permit additional information to be obtained later, if required.
1.7. 3 As events unfold during a SAR incident, they should be recorded in a diary or log which will become 
part of the permanent case folder. The entries in the diary or log will be the primary record of the

chronology of the case, which can be important for showing what information was available at each 
key decision point during the incident. Format is not important, though it is recommended that each 
page have the date and case name or case identifying number, all pages be consecutively numbered, 
and the time for every entry be recorded.

 SAR forms
1.7.4 SAR forms serve many purposes and are in different formats. Their purposes include documenting 
information from the distressed craft, facilitating communications between RCCs and RSCs, briefing 
SAR crews, search planning, and facilitating communications among the SMC, OSC and SAR facilities. 
SAR forms are discussed throughout this volume and samples are provided in the appendices.

SAR charts and overlays
1.7. 5 Sometimes the easiest way to organize geographic information during a SAR incident is to plot it on 
a chart. This is impractical if the RCC’s case load is significant because no RCC has an inexhaustible 
supply of charts. The practical alternative is to plot all case-related information on flimsy paper or 
clear plastic laid over the top of the appropriate chart. If a separate flimsy overlay is used for basic case

information and for laying out each search, it is much easier to evaluate what areas have been covered 
adequately and what areas will need further effort.
1.7.6 Electronic charting systems/geographic information systems (GIS) make it possible to create separate 
records of incident information plots regardless of the number of incidents being handled. The records 
are stored electronically and may also be printed for portable use, briefings, etc.

1.7.7 At the end of the case, these records should be marked with the date that each pertains to and with 
the case name or identifying case number. They then should be filed in the case incident folder.
 SAR case files
1.7.8 All information pertaining to a specific SAR incident should be placed in an easily identified and 
labelled file folder and then stored. How long records are retained in storage is something each

SC needs to decide. Some States retain all records for a few years and then place files dealing with 
significant, historically important, or sensitive incidents into permanent secure storage, discarding 
those dealing with routine matters. Establishing a policy on which types of cases belong in the 
“routine” category is a SAR management duty. Files pertaining to incidents that become the subject of

legal proceedings should be retained until those proceedings are complete, including all appeals and 
legal reviews. Files that are to be permanently retained should be prominently marked so that they are 
not inadvertently discarded with the routine files.
 SAR case analysis
1.7.9 To improve the overall SAR system effectiveness, RCC staff must help SAR managers review 
performance. SAR case analysis, discussed in chapter 9, can be a useful method for this review. In

general, this analysis involves:
 – reviewing specific cases to uncover lessons learned that can be applied in future operations; and
 – analysing cumulative data to discover trends that may impact the allocation and location of SAR 
resources.
1.8 Training and exercises
1.8.1 The head of a SAR service is responsible for establishment of training programmes for SAR personnel 
to reach and maintain a high level of competence. The head of each facility is responsible for the

training of personnel in the specialized techniques and procedures assigned to them, while each 
individual must assume responsibility to perform competently any assigned task.
1.8.2 Training of SAR service personnel can include the following:
 – study of the application of SAR procedures, techniques and equipment through lectures, 
demonstrations, films, SAR manuals and journals;
 – assisting in or observing actual operations; and

– exercises in which personnel are trained to coordinate individual procedures, practice skills and 
techniques in a simulated operation.

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 1-11
1.8.3 Training provides basic knowledge and skills. The head of the facility should have qualification and 
certification processes to ensure that personnel have sufficient experience, maturity, and judgement 
to perform assigned tasks.
(a) During a qualification process, the individual must, by demonstration of abilities, show mental

and physical competence to perform as part of a team. Detailed qualification requirements 
vary with each type of workplace (a vessel, aircraft, or RCC). The trainee may be assigned to an 
associate who observes and can attest to the trainee’s competence to perform each particular 
task. Thorough knowledge of the geographic area of operation should also be demonstrated.
(b) Certification is official recognition by the organization that it trusts the individual to use those

abilities. Certain tasks may require periodic re-certification.
 Note: The term “certification” is widely used by IMO, ICAO, and other organizations within the 
contexts of authorizing personnel or facilities to perform certain functions. In this chapter, certification 
is similarly used to authorize a properly trained and qualified person to perform assigned tasks.
 Exercises
1.8.4 To reach a high degree of proficiency, all SAR facilities should periodically take part in coordinated

SAR operations. Exercises may be used when the number of SAR operations is low, and especially 
with neighbouring States. Exercises test and improve operational plans and communications, provide 
learning experience, and improve liaison and coordination skills. Exercises should be conducted on 
three levels.
(a) The most simple type of exercise, a communications exercise, requires the least planning. It

consists of periodic use of all means of communications between all potential users to ensure 
capability for actual emergencies.
(b) A coordination exercise involves simulated response to an emergency based on a series of 
scenarios. All levels of the SAR service are involved but do not deploy. This type of exercise 
can require considerable planning, especially where a number of other units or organizations

are involved, and usually takes one to three days to execute. However, simulation exercises can 
be carried out more simply, for example, RCC personnel can conduct “internal” coordination 
exercises to simulate response to a scenario and practise their skills, techniques, procedures and 
processes. This may be as part of a programme of personnel competency maintenance training.
(c) The third type, a full-scale exercise or a field exercise, differs from the previous type in that

actual SAR facilities are deployed. This increases the scope of SAR system testing and adds 
realistic constraints due to times involved in launching, transit, and activities of the SAR facilities.
1.8.5 Sample scenarios for a coordination exercise are provided below.
(a) A light aircraft that has not filed a flight plan is reported missing. Based on information received 
subsequently, the flight is reconstructed and all necessary actions are taken.

(b) A transport aircraft with a flight plan fails to make a position report or makes a distress call 
without giving a position. A simulated communication search is carried out and an air search is 
planned. A simulated search is then conducted with input from various simulated sources.
(c) A ship is reported 24 hours overdue at its destination. A simulated search is carried out, using 
datum line search planning techniques. A simulated communication search is conducted

involving relevant RCCs. Radio or satellite broadcasts are simulated.
1.8.6 The full-scale exercise requires detailed planning since actual SAR facilities are deployed, and it offers 
detailed, realistic experience and opportunities for testing and evaluating. The following may serve as 
a guide in developing a distress scenario.
(a) A search object resembling an aircraft is set up at an undisclosed location. A simulated flight

plan is filed and one or two simulated position reports are received, but nothing more is heard 
until the aircraft is overdue at its destination. The appropriate emergency phase is declared and

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
1-12 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
a simulated communication search is conducted. The SMC will assess all available information, 
plan a search (based on chapters 4 and 5 of this volume), and dispatch search facilities. Also, 
simulated reports from other reporting sources are received. Some of these reports will help in 
determining the correct search areas while others may be deliberately misleading. The text of all

messages between participants in the exercise should begin with a prefix such as “EXERCISE” or 
“SAREX” to avoid any misunderstanding. The exercise ends when the search object is found.
(b) If the exercise concerns only the rescue of survivors, the SMC is given the exact location of the 
distress scene and the apparent condition of the survivors. The SMC must decide on the best 
method for rescue with available facilities and may send land vehicles, vessels and aircraft.

A doctor, if available, could accompany the SAR facilities. On-scene SAR personnel may be 
required to transfer stretcher cases to the evacuation craft. Pararescue and medical teams could 
be sent and required to set up triage arrangements and support survivors using air-dropped 
survival stores.
1.8.7 The scale on which a combined multiple-agency exercise should be conducted and the number of 
facilities which should take part will depend upon the following:

– extent of the particular SAR service;
 – anticipated demands upon the SAR service;
 – extent to which private organizations and other agencies could be involved and on the SAR 
experience of their personnel;
 – time interval since the last combined exercise; and
 – general considerations of economy and value to and availability of participating facilities.
1.8.8 Planning involves: development of the concept (broad goals and objectives) of what is to be exercised;

selection of participants (staff and facilities); detailed planning for how the exercise will be conducted; 
conduct of the exercise; and evaluation to determine lessons learned and to develop recommendations 
for future improvements. It is essential to have a clear understanding of which plans and procedures 
are being exercised. Scenarios can then be developed that pose specific situations to which personnel

will react and respond. Response, or lack of response, in accordance with established policy and 
guidance, and need for additional policy guidance, is evaluated.
1.8.9 The evaluation process is crucial. Inputs should come from a team of evaluation experts who observe 
the exercise and from personnel who actually participated in the exercise scenarios. Those observing 
and evaluating the response must have expertise in the areas they are evaluating and clearly understand

what is being evaluated. The evaluators should be familiar with how to properly handle the situations 
being posed and then record the participant’s response to the objectives of the exercise. The final step 
is identification of weaknesses and development of recommendations for improvement. Subsequent 
exercises would emphasize these recommended changes and other concerns.
1.8.10 Adjacent RCCs should periodically carry out SAR exercises together to develop and maintain efficient

cooperation and coordination between their services. These exercises need not always be on a large 
scale, but at least those SAR facilities which are likely to operate together should engage periodically 
in coordinating exercises. Much may be learned by exchanging information on training methods (e.g. 
programmes, literature, and films) and visits between staff of adjacent SRRs.
1.8.11 Additional information on planning and conducting exercises is provided in chapter 6 with regard

to mass rescue operations and in appendix O in IAMSAR Manual, volume I, Organization and 
Management, with a sample template for a joint search and rescue exercise.
 Training of RCC and RSC personnel
1.8.12 The RCC and RSC have particularly important duties. Their personnel usually need formal SAR 
training. If unable to immediately attend formal training, they must receive a period of on-the-job 
training. Upon completion of training, the prospective RCC personnel should undergo qualification

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 1-13
procedures. RCC staff should be fully qualified in SAR incident analysis, search planning, and SAR 
operations management.
1.8.13 One advantage of combining aeronautical and maritime RCCs into a joint RCC, and staffing the 
facility with both aviation and maritime specialists, is a synergistic approach to the solution of SAR

incidents. RCC staff can share subject matter expertise and determine a more balanced and complete 
evaluation of each incident.
1.8.14 The formal training of RCC personnel should include:
 – organization:
 – knowledge of the SAR organization and its relationship to the air traffic services;
 – knowledge of the SAR organization and its relationship to maritime safety and 
communication services;
 – knowledge of agreements made with facilities, neighbouring SAR services, etc.;

– knowledge of capabilities and limitations of available facilities; and
 – knowledge of legal aspects, e.g. in a maritime incident, policies on towing and salvage;
 – procedures:
 – how to obtain and evaluate information and reports;
 – alerting of facilities and commencement of SAR operations;
 – interpretation of different systems of position reporting;
 – determination of a search area;
 – search techniques and patterns for air, maritime and land facilities;

– plotting of search information;
 – communications procedures;
 – rescue procedures;
 – supply-dropping procedures;
 – ditching assistance, interception and escort procedures; and
 – briefing and questioning of SAR personnel;
 – administration:
 – routine administrative functions; and
 – information:
 – visits to SAR facilities and supply depots, and participation in exercises, including packing 
and loading of survival stores; and

and loading of survival stores; and
 – instruction through films, relevant journals, etc., on recent developments in the field of SAR.
1.8.15 RCC and RSC SAR training should also include many other topics. If search planning skills, knowledge 
and expertise gained from formal training are not used on a regular basis for operations or exercises, 
then periodic recurrent training must be implemented to ensure reliable and effective delivery of SAR 
services. Subject matter should include:

Facilities. This would include aspects of training for support facilities for mobile units, such as depots.
1.9 Improving professionalism
1.9.1 To increase the professionalism of their respective organizations, SAR personnel should:
 – ensure that SAR procedures developed by IMO and ICAO are followed, and that supplemental

plans of operation and procedures suitable to local SAR scenarios are developed and followed;
 – ensure that SAR personnel have the maturity and competence to carry out assigned tasks;
 – make arrangements to use all available resources for SAR, to the extent practicable;
 – arrange to work with other States, especially as provided for in SAR agreements, and ensure that 
responsible personnel understand and follow such agreements;
 – keep a complete and accurate log of operations;

– properly investigate and report any problems, and find ways to apply lessons learned to prevent 
future recurrences; and
 – ensure that once some specific step is taken (perhaps acknowledgement of a distress alert) which 
would lead those in distress to expect assistance, every effort is made to follow through, particularly 
since the survivors may forego other opportunities for help based on this understanding.
1.10 Public relations

1.10 Public relations
1.10.1 The public should be informed during SAR operations, within the limits of confidentiality, of SAR 
system actions. The potential benefits of early release of information include:
 – additional information from the public, leading to more effective use of SAR resources;
 – fewer time-consuming requests from the news media; and
 – reduction in inaccurate public speculation about the SAR mission.

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 1-15
1.10.2 A SAR operation often creates great interest with the general public and with radio, television and 
newspapers. Contacts with media are normally the responsibility of managers or public affairs 
specialists, but may also be delegated to the RCC. It is important that a good relationship between 
the media and the RCC is established to ensure that information reaching the public is factual and

complete. This relationship should be established prior to any major incident. The RCC should use the 
media to communicate its overall image, the services provided, and its impact on the community. The 
RCC can accomplish this by:
 – providing information to the local media about the RCC and the services it provides;
 – providing “good will” stories on an ongoing basis to build up the credibility with the media as a 
professional, concerned, and open organization; and

– taking every opportunity to present news so that when a major SAR operation is being conducted, 
the media will be knowledgeable in reporting it.
1.10.3 Contact with the media can take many forms.
(a) In order to ensure the formulation of a consistent and controlled message to the public, media 
relations personnel should be designated as the focal point for the releases of information 
relating to SAR operations. In the conduct of major operations, the RCC should not normally be

the contact point for the media because of the potential for negative impact on SAR operations 
if media interest becomes too extensive. All information released by the RCC should normally 
be approved by the SMC and appropriate authorities, and contain only factual information.
(b) Once initial media information has been released, the RCC should consider programming and 
advertising regular and frequent updates in order to address the needs of the media. These could

take the form of further press releases or holding press conferences. A press conference gives the 
RCC the opportunity to initiate the following actions:
 – give information;
 – give interviews;
 – answer questions;
 – summarize what has happened and what the RCC is doing in order for the media to fully 
understand what has occurred;
 – give the RCC a “human face;” and
 – give the media controlled opportunities to obtain video footage, photographs, and audio 
for broadcast use.

for broadcast use.
(c) Interviews can be conducted. To avoid wrong information and misunderstandings, normally 
only a designated spokesperson should conduct interviews with the media. This will also allow 
the RCC to remain focused on its planning efforts. The spokesperson should be in direct contact 
with the RCC to ensure that complete and up-to-date information is obtained. In interviews with 
the media, the RCC spokesperson should exercise good judgement and avoid:

– personal judgements or demeaning information on the:
 – crew or missing persons; and
 – judgement, experience, behaviour or training of the master, pilot  in command, or 
the crew;
 – degrading opinions on the conduct of SAR operations (only factual information should be 
given);
 – personal opinions or theories as to why the accident occurred or how it could have been 
avoided;
 – being unduly pessimistic or optimistic on the chances of success;

– giving names of missing or distressed persons until every effort has been made to inform 
the relatives;

Chapter 1 – The search and rescue system
1-16 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 – giving the name of the operator or the owner of the aircraft, ship or other craft before they 
have been informed; and
 – revealing names of persons who have given information related to the case.
(d) On the other hand, the type of information that the RCC spokesman could release, depending 
on the specific circumstances of the SAR operation, includes, but is not limited to:

– general reason for the SAR operation;
 – type of aircraft or vessel involved;
 – owner/operator of the aircraft or vessel (only after the owner/operator has been informed 
and given consent);
 – name of vessel/flight number (only after the owner/operator has been informed and given 
consent);
 – number of people on board;
 – general area being searched;
 – number and types of aircraft and vessels engaged in the search and the number of hours 
flown;

flown;
 – arrangements for land or marine search (as applicable);
 – details of other authorities participating in the search;
 – contact number for use by the next of kin to obtain information;
 – contact number for further information; and
 – contact number for media enquiries.
1.10.4 Release of names can be a sensitive issue. Guidelines should be established in accordance with 
international and national laws and regulations.

international and national laws and regulations.
(a) Names of civilian casualties should not be released until every effort has been made to contact 
family relatives. To accomplish notification, use whatever national and local public agencies are 
available. Until the relatives have been notified, normally only the number of deceased, survivors, 
and injured survivors should be released. Names of military casualties should be released only

by the military service to which the casualties belong. When circumstances permit, queries on 
such casualties should be referred to the parent military service.
(b) Names of survivors should not be released until positive identification has been accomplished. 
Generally, survivor information should not be released prior to release of casualty information, 
although circumstances may permit exceptions. Survivors should be encouraged and assisted in

contacting their families as soon as possible. However, SMCs should brief survivors on releasing 
information and possible reasons for withholding information.
1.10.5 When a major incident occurs, such as with a large aircraft or cruise ship, hundreds of persons may 
be at risk, involving many nationalities. Such an incident may result in the need for mass rescue 
operations (MROs), which are discussed in chapter 6. In this situation, the RCC could become the

focus of world attention. Such events will undoubtedly require the involvement of other emergency 
service providers and a concerted effort will be required by the RCC if a consistent and controlled 
message to the public is to be maintained. Actions by the RCC may include the following:
 – request representatives from responding organizations (including the aircraft or ship operator, as 
appropriate) to help staff a joint media relations team;
 – select a spokesperson;

– select a spokesperson;
 – issue regular press releases and social media updates, agreed, whenever possible, with the other 
responders;
 – make agreed information available on the Internet;
 – actively monitor media reports including social media to ensure correct information is being 
broadcast/published;
 – schedule joint press conferences;
 – prepare a room for the media; and
 – control media access to the RCC and in other operational areas as appropriate.

1.10.6 Other considerations for public relations and management of a major incident include the following 
points:
(a) As soon as it is apparent to the RCC public relations staff that a major incident has occurred, 
informing the media will help establish the RCC as a primary source of information. Be clear, 
concise, and informative. Do not speculate.
(b) Establishing the nationalities of those at risk will assist in anticipating where media enquiries will

come from, and will assist in reducing media enquiries from States whose citizens are not involved.
(c) Scheduling regular media conferences and updates, including regular social media updates, 
can help reduce the volume of media enquiries and assist with maintenance of consistent and 
correct public information. Media updates should also take into account international time zone 
differences.
(d) Due consideration should be given to the language used with the media. Local and international

interest in the SAR operation may require use of a common language or availability of translators.
(e) Ensure that arrangements are in place to deal sensitively with enquiries from friends and families 
of those involved and, where possible, to update next of kin ahead of the media.
(f) Assign appropriate personnel to manage information demands from government and other 
senior levels.
1.10.7 The SMC should be aware of the concerns of the relatives of missing persons. Waiting during searches

and lack of information can be stressful to family members of those in distress, which could also 
affect RCC performance. During the search, the SMC or staff should maintain regular contact with 
the relatives to provide information and outline future plans; if possible, contact telephone numbers 
should be issued for relatives. Providing access to SMC headquarters, if appropriate, enables relatives

to see the search effort. These steps assist the relatives in accepting the SMC’s decision to conclude 
search operations even if the missing persons are not located.
1.10.8 Additional information on planning and public and media relations is provided in chapter 6 with 
regard to mass rescue operations.
1.11 Computer resources
1.11.1 Large amounts of computing and data storage capability can be obtained and maintained at a relatively

low cost. Modern software makes development of helpful forms, computer aids, databases, and 
sometimes even some communications reasonably easy and inexpensive. Such aids can be developed 
by the user and do not require highly specialized expertise in the computing sciences. This is not true 
for software that directly addresses the search planning problem. Developing such software requires 
specialized expertise in computer modelling, the application of search theory and the application of

environmental sciences such as meteorology and oceanography to SAR. Paragraph 1.11.9 lists some 
of the functional characteristics that should be considered for search planning software.
1.11.2 Forms. Word-processing software provides the capability to develop standard forms that best meet 
local, national, and regional needs. These forms may be printed on paper and completed by hand, or 
completed on the computer via the word processor. The functions of such forms include:

– ensuring critical data items are not forgotten;
 – ensuring calculations are done in the correct order;
 – saving time for the writer by having all standard information already on the form and requiring 
that only variable items need to be entered; and
 – saving time for the reader by having all information presented in a standard, predictable format.

1-18 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
1.11.3 Examples of forms which may be useful include:
 – search action plans;
 – checklists;
 – situation reports; and
 – search planning worksheets.
1.11.4 Computer aids. The availability of electronic spreadsheets makes development of computer aids 
possible without doing computer programming in the traditional sense. Most of the work required

by search planning worksheets, for example, could be done easily in spreadsheets. Having such 
spreadsheets helps in at least two respects.
(a) The search planner would have to enter only values needed as inputs. The spreadsheet software 
would do all the calculations required to produce the outputs (answers). This would relieve the 
search planner of most of the computational burden, reduce the potential for errors, and save 
valuable time.

valuable time.
(b) If an input value changed, the search planner would have to simply change the value of that item 
in the spreadsheet and all values based on it would be re-computed automatically, saving time 
and reducing the possibility of error.
1.11.5 A common use of spreadsheets is to track financial matters. The RCC and SAR managers can use this 
tool to prepare budgets, track expenditures, forecast fiscal requirements, and for other uses.

1.11.6 Databases. The primary purpose of most databases is to store detailed information. This information 
may then be accessed rapidly if detailed data is required, or consolidated and summarized into useful 
reports. Examples are shown below.
(a) SAR system management data. Number of alerts received by the system, number of responses, 
number of sorties, number of SRU hours expended while engaged in SAR activities, SAR incident

locations, dates, times, numbers of lives saved, and value of property saved are some of the 
many types of information a SAR manager may find useful.
(b) Search planning. The RCC may develop its own databases as well as make use of existing 
database programs on a variety of information valuable to search planning. Examples include: 
 – an index to previous SAR incidents by distressed craft name or other identifier could lead

to valuable information about that craft if it is involved in a later incident; 
 – a database of known debris locations from previous aircraft crashes or forced landings 
over land, or vessels recently sunk, may avoid wasting valuable search time investigating 
old SAR incident sites;
 – in the maritime area, a database of past drift trajectories could improve estimates of survivor 
location in future incidents; and

location in future incidents; and 
 – an environmental database, including sea currents, water temperatures, winds currents, 
etc.
(c)  Facilities and agencies
 – a database of SAR and medical facilities, such as hyperbaric chambers and hospitals and 
their capabilities, could aid rescue planners in determining the best place to take injured 
survivors; and 
 – lists of frequently-called agencies and telephone numbers can be kept in a database and 
rapidly accessed, when needed.

rapidly accessed, when needed.
1.11.7 Computer communications. Many computers can communicate electronically. The communications 
medium is usually either a modem connected to ordinary telephone lines or a network card in the 
computer connecting it to a local area or wide area network (LAN or WAN). Before depending on 
this type of communication, however, SAR system managers, search planners, etc. need to confirm 
the availability and reliability of the communications path.

1.11.8 SAR data providers. There are basically two types of SAR data. First, there is data which might provide 
additional clues about the SAR incident, the survivors, or their craft which could help in finding the 
survivors. Second, there is data which is used directly in the search planning and rescue processes. 
Some data, such as weather, fall into both categories. 
(a) Data of the first type may already reside in existing databases. For example, if a State has a boat

registration programme, information the search planner would find useful about a missing boat 
may be available in the database. Lloyds Registry of Shipping maintains an extensive database on 
commercial shipping, including specific data on the current status and history of virtually every 
vessel engaged in transoceanic trade. The Internet often provides a means to access this data as 
well as business and individual web sites which might provide pertinent information about the

craft or persons in distress.
(b) Data of the second type includes weather, wind, and sea current data which might be available 
from local weather bureaus. It could also include ship reporting systems such as Amver, which 
maintain a continuously updated plot of estimated locations for participating merchant vessels.
1.11.9 Computer-based search planning. The use of computers to support the search planning process

is growing as it offers the SAR Coordinator greater flexibility to calculate a refined search area. 
Although there may be a tendency to computerize the manual method, computerizing this overly 
simplified pencil-and-paper technique should be avoided. Computers make much more sophisticated 
techniques feasible, such as making the best use of increasingly available detailed environmental data 
for modelling and predicting drift, creating and testing various scenarios, integrating and evaluating

the impact of late-arriving information, and simulating changes in the search object’s status and type, 
etc. Perhaps most importantly, such models can produce optimal search plans that maximize the 
probability of success. SAR Coordinators are cautioned that they should be familiar with the basic 
theories of each Search Planning element to fully take advantage of the search planning software. SAR

Coordinators are also reminded that computers are only devices that provide support; they cannot 
make important decisions and the quality of their outputs can only be as good as the quality of the 
inputs. Further information may be found in appendix P of this publication.
1.11.10 Display of vessel tracking data. A computer system with geographic information system (GIS) display 
capability is important for displaying vessel tracking data sourced from AIS, LRIT, VMS, VTS and other

sources. The location of SAR units can also be tracked and displayed, as can search areas and other 
information.
1.12 Decision and management support
1.12.1 The Incident Command System (ICS) is a management tool growing in international use for managing 
any emergency event. It consists of procedures for organizing personnel, facilities, equipment, 
and communications at the scene of an emergency. ICS is intended to quickly blend numerous

organizations into an effective response organization for any type and magnitude of emergency. ICS is 
a highly flexible concept for managing emergency events involving multiple jurisdictions and multiple 
agencies, such as major disasters or events involving hazardous materials. Similar systems should be 
used when ICS is not available.
(a) ICS enables:
 – standardization of management systems among agencies and organizations;
 – management in both simple and complex emergency situations;

– incoming resources to fit into the total emergency response system;
 – a manageable span-of-control; and
 – clear lines of authority.

(b) SAR is often a component of emergency response. Where ICS is implemented, SAR facilities may 
conduct simultaneous operations along with other types of responders under ICS management. 
ICS does not take control or authority away from the SAR service. Rather, the SMC, OSC or 
someone designated by the SMC serves as an “agency representative” to coordinate the SAR

response with an “incident commander”, who is recognized by an applicable emergency 
response plan as having overall responsibility for actions on scene.
(c) RCCs and RSCs should be aware of the general concepts of ICS where it is implemented. State 
emergency response, disaster response, or other similar agencies which use ICS are potential 
sources of guidance.

Communications
2.1 Distress communications
2.1.1 This chapter introduces distress alerting and SAR communications, and discusses mobile and 
land-based uses of communications equipment. The basic information on aeronautical and maritime 
communications, frequencies, equipment, and procedures provided here will need to be supplemented 
to gain adequate expertise. Specific information on how to use the systems and equipment must be

obtained from communication service providers, equipment manufacturers, training institutions, and 
other available sources. Since the field of communications is vast, RCCs may find it useful to employ 
communications experts if they handle the majority of their communications needs directly.
2.1.2 Distress traffic includes all messages relating to immediate assistance required by persons, aircraft,

or marine craft in distress, including medical assistance. Distress traffic may also include SAR 
communications and on-scene communications. Distress calls take absolute priority over all other 
transmissions; anyone receiving a distress call must immediately cease any transmissions which may 
interfere with the call and listen on the frequency used for the call.
2.1.3 Distress and safety communications require the highest possible integrity and protection from

harmful interference. Any interference which puts at risk the operation of safety services or degrades, 
obstructs or interrupts any radio communications is harmful. Some frequencies are protected, in that 
they have no authorized uses other than for distress and safety. SAR personnel should be the last of 
all people to cause harmful interference, and should cooperate with law-enforcement authorities to 
report and stop incidents of interference.

report and stop incidents of interference.
2.1.4 Distress alerts may arrive at RCCs from a variety of equipment sources and via a variety of alerting posts. 
Alerting posts include, but are not limited to, coast radio stations (CRSs), local user terminals (LUTs) 
and mission control centres (MCCs) of the Cospas-Sarsat System, shore-based facilities for mobile 
satellite services, air traffic services (ATS) units, commercially  available emergency notification

device service providers, public safety units such as police and fire departments, and vessels, 
aircraft, or other persons or facilities which may receive and relay such alerts. Alerting posts are any 
intermediary facilities which relay distress alerts between their source and the responsible RCC, and 
may even include other RCCs.
2.1.5 Aircraft or vessels in distress may use any means available to attract attention, make their positions 
known, and obtain help.

known, and obtain help.
2.2 Aeronautical mobile service
2.2.1 When an RCC is involved with an aeronautical emergency, close coordination will be needed 
between the RCC, the aircraft in distress, and various aeronautical services directly involved with 
aircraft operations. Some functions described below which are important to RCC duties may be 
performed by other than RCC personnel, by staff which perform both RCC and other duties, etc.,

depending upon the circumstances of the RCC and the aircraft in distress.
2.2.2 Frequency bands allocated by ITU for the aeronautical mobile service include some in the high 
frequency (HF) spectrum (3,000 to 30,000 kHz), the very high frequency (VHF) spectrum (30 to 
300 MHz), and the ultra-high frequency (UHF) spectrum (300 to 3,000 MHz).

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
2.2.3 Initial transmissions of aeronautical distress messages normally are on the frequency being used 
for en-route communications with the aeronautical stations. SAR facilities proceeding to assist 
aircraft should establish communications on that frequency. The frequency may be obtained from 
the controlling surface station; it will normally be used for initial communications and for ensuing

communications among the distressed aircraft, assisting aircraft, and controlling surface radio station. 
Otherwise, when a SAR facility is within radio range of a distressed aircraft, the initial contact frequency 
would normally be 121.5 MHz for civil aircraft or 243 MHz for military aircraft of some States.
2.2.4 SAR procedures should be initiated if an aircraft or vessel becomes overdue or fails to make a report.

For aircraft, this is usually accomplished through an ATS unit or the flight plan system. However, if 
radar or communications are unexpectedly lost with an instrument flight rules (IFR) or visual flight 
rules (VFR) aircraft, SAR procedures may be initiated.
2.2.5 Normally, a pilot should not be asked to change frequencies during an emergency without good 
reason. However, if the aircraft is in a remote location, air traffic facilities based at or near that

location may be in a better position to assist. A decision to change a frequency should be based on 
the circumstances.
2.2.6 If necessary, and if weather and circumstances permit, RCCs may recommend that the aircraft 
maintains or increases altitude to improve communications, radar, or direction-finding (DF) reception.
2.2.7 ICAO Regional Air Navigation Plans (RANPs) or other regional SAR plans or agreements may provide

guidance on selection of appropriate aeronautical frequency bands for SAR. (RANPs and other 
ICAO documents may be obtained from ICAO.)
 VHF communications
2.2.8 The 121.5 MHz VHF-AM aeronautical emergency frequency is normally only used for calling or for 
emergencies. In emergencies, the frequency may be used to provide:
 – a clear channel between aircraft in distress and a ground station when normal channels are 
being used for other aircraft;

being used for other aircraft;
 – a channel between aircraft and aerodromes not normally used by international air traffic;
 – a common channel between aircraft, and between aircraft and surface facilities, involved in 
SAR operations;
 – air-to-ground communications between aircraft and suitably equipped vessels and survival craft;
 – air-to-ground communications with aircraft when airborne equipment failure prevents use of 
regular channels;

regular channels;
 – a common channel between civil aircraft and intercepting aircraft or intercept control units, 
and between civil or intercepting aircraft and an ATS unit, if civil aircraft are intercepted; and
 – a means for locating the signal source via land-based or mobile direction-finding.
2.2.9 Where a VHF frequency is needed for a common VHF channel between aircraft, and between 
aircraft and surface services involved in SAR operations, 123.1 MHz should be used when possible,

and 121.5 MHz used if an additional frequency is needed. An ELT, EPIRB or PLB transmitting on 
121.5 MHz may make the use of this frequency impractical for communications.
2.2.10 121.5 MHz services are normally available at any aeronautical facility where needed to ensure 
immediate reception of distress calls. Aerodromes should always monitor 121.5 MHz for voice 
emergency calls and ELT aural signals (which have a WOW WOW sound from the transmission of 
two alternating tones).

two alternating tones).
 HF communications 
2.2.11 Frequencies 3,023 kHz, 4,125 kHz, and 5,680 kHz may be used for on-scene and SAR coordination 
communications when range dictates need for high frequencies, when use of other frequencies or 
other factors make these the best frequencies available, or as a means for vessels and aircraft to 
communicate with each other.
2.3 Maritime radio service

2.3 Maritime radio service
2.3.1 Ships communicate with coast radio stations and with each other on maritime frequencies available 
in MF, HF and VHF bands. The GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System) is mandatory 
for all SOLAS ships. Volume I, appendix G provides more information on carriage requirements for 
SOLAS ships.

maritime services.

maritime services.
2.3.3 The frequency 2,182 kHz, an international maritime voice distress and safety frequency, is also 
available in designated SAR aircraft. 
 HF communications
2.3.4 A wide range of maritime HF frequencies are allocated, and subdivided for radiotelegraphy and 
radiotelephony. In certain areas of the world the radiotelephone frequencies 4,125 kHz and 6,215 kHz 
are designated to supplement the frequency 2,182 kHz for distress and safety purposes. HF radio

can be useful in polar regions where geostationary satellite coverage may be limited. Also, HF email 
capability exists.
 VHF communications
2.3.5 The frequency 156.8 MHz FM (channel 16) is the international VHF maritime voice distress, 
safety, and calling frequency. The frequency 156.3 MHz (channel 06) may be used on scene. AIS 
transmission from ships provides vessel identity, location and other information which can be useful 
for SAR purposes.
2.4 Modes of emission

for SAR purposes.
2.4 Modes of emission
2.4.1 Two radios which operate on a common frequency can usually communicate with each other within 
range; however, they must also use the same mode of emission. Emission modes are discussed 
in the ITU Radio Regulations. Different emission modes could prevent an aircraft and ship from 
communicating directly with each other even if they share a common frequency.
2.5 Global Maritime Distress and Safety System

2.5 Global Maritime Distress and Safety System
2.5.1 Ships subject to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention are obliged to be outfitted with certain 
communications equipment, collectively referred to as the shipboard portion of the Global Maritime 
Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). Certain fishing vessels and other marine craft may also carry 
GMDSS-compatible equipment.
2.5.2 Information on communications equipment which each SOLAS vessel carries should be available to

RCCs via ITU publications and databases, if the vessel’s flag State promptly informs ITU as required. 
Otherwise, RCCs may need to seek this data from the flag States, communications service providers, 
ship reporting system databases, or other sources. The information sources are called SAR data 
providers (SDPs); all GMDSS equipment should be registered with ITU or other suitable SDP which 
makes the data readily available to RCCs worldwide to support SAR.

2.5.3 RCC personnel should be familiar with the SOLAS GMDSS provisions, and associated IMO 
documents. GMDSS takes advantage of available technology to shift alerting emphasis from ship 
to ship (though this can still be done), and towards ship to shore, where SAR professionals can help 
arrange assistance. GMDSS capabilities of vessels not subject to SOLAS range from full compliance 
with SOLAS to no capabilities at all.

with SOLAS to no capabilities at all.
2.5.4 GMDSS-equipped ships can be expected to perform the following functions wherever they operate:
 – transmit ship-to-shore distress alerts by two independent means;
 – receive shore-to-ship alerts (usually relayed by RCCs); and

 – receive shore-to-ship alerts (usually relayed by RCCs); and

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 – transmit and receive:
 – ship-to-ship alerts;
 – SAR coordinating communications;
 – on-scene communications;
 – locating signals;
 – maritime safety information;
 – general radio communications to and from shore; and
 – bridge-to-bridge communications.
2.5.5 Most SOLAS ships can be expected to have at least the following equipment (consult the SOLAS 
Convention and paragraphs 2.5.6 through 2.5.14 for requirements):

– VHF radiotelephone (channels 6, 13 and 16);
 – VHF-DSC (channel 70) transmitter and watch receiver;
 – SART (radar) and/or AIS-SART;
 – NAVTEX receiver;
 – EGC if operating outside NAVTEX range; and
 – EPIRB, as appropriate.
2.5.6 Channel 6 may be used for communications with vessels for SAR operations. Channel 13 is used for 
safety of navigation ship to ship. Channel 16 is used for distress and safety traffic, and also may be

used by aircraft for safety purposes. Channel 70 is used as a digital selective calling (DSC) channel 
in the maritime mobile service for distress, safety, calling, and reply.
2.5.7 DSC is used for calling and replying, and for transmitting, acknowledging and relaying distress 
alerts. It allows a specific station to be contacted and made aware that the calling station wishes to 
communicate with it, and to indicate how to reply, or what station to listen to for subsequent distress

traffic. It also can make “all ships” calls. Follow-up communications are made on an appropriate 
non-DSC frequency. DSC radio users need to understand the basic operation of the radio, how DSC 
acts as an automated watch, and the importance of registering the radio and keeping it on and tuned 
to the DSC channel.
2.5.8 SOLAS ships sailing beyond range of a VHF-DSC coast radio station must also have an MF-DSC

(2,187 .5 kHz) transmitter and watch receiver. If sailing beyond range of an MF-DSC coast radio 
station, they must have an IMO-recognized mobile satellite service Ship Earth Station (SES) or 
an MF/HF-DSC transmitter and watch receiver including narrow-band direct printing (NBDP). If 
operating outside coverage of the IMO-recognized mobile satellite service fitted to a ship (e.g. in the 
polar areas), they must have the MF/HF-DSC capability.

2.5.9 Narrow-band direct printing (NBDP) is a radio telex system.
2.5.10 A search and rescue radar transponder (SART) interacts with vessel or aircraft radars (9 GHz) for 
locating survival craft. SART responses show up as a distinctive line of 12 equally spaced blips on 
compatible radar displays, providing a bearing and range to the SART. A SART is a portable device 
which should be taken into a lifeboat or liferaft when abandoning ship.

2.5.11 AIS search and rescue transmitter (AIS-SART) is a portable manual deployment survivor-locating 
device intended for use on liferafts or survival craft and is an alternative to a radar SART. The device 
sends updated position reports using a standard AIS class A position report. It has a built-in GNSS 
receiver.
2.5.12 NAVTEX is an NBDP telex system for promulgating safety information which is automatically printed

by an on-board NAVTEX receiver. NAVTEX range is generally less than 300 nautical miles from the 
broadcasting station. NAVTEX receivers are designed to ignore repeated broadcasts they have already 
received, and to sound an alarm upon receipt of urgent or distress traffic. Users can programme the 
equipment to receive only the types of information they want to be automatically printed out. All 
properly formatted NAVTEX messages contain a content indicator in their heading. The printing of

certain categories of messages cannot be suppressed regardless of the number of times it is received. 
NAVTEX receivers are relatively inexpensive; boaters and other seafarers should be encouraged to 
use them and to leave them turned on when under way.
2.5.13 Enhanced group call (EGC) is provided by IMO-recognized mobile satellite services and complements 
the NAVTEX system. IMO-recognized mobile satellite services and their capabilities are further

discussed later in this chapter. Broadcasts are used by SAR, meteorological, and navigation 
authorities for promulgation of maritime safety information (MSI) and SAR-related information. Some 
Inmarsat LESs also offer EGC FleetNET services used for fleet management and general information 
to particular groups of ships; RCCs may find such services useful for certain applications, such as 
sending messages to a standard list of other RCCs.

2.5.14 GMDSS introduces better communications for certain vessels, but leaves the existing terrestrial 
system for others; some effects are that SAR authorities must support two maritime mobile systems, 
and some vessels cannot call each other. For example, if SOLAS ships discontinue watchkeeping 
on channel 16 in favour of automated technologies, most vessels will still depend on channel 16 for 
distress, safety, and calling.
2.6 406 MHz distress beacons – EPIRB, ELT and PLB

2.6 406 MHz distress beacons – EPIRB, ELT and PLB
2.6.1 Maritime emergency position-indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs) have been accepted into the GMDSS. 
These beacons operate on 406 MHz and may have a 121.5 MHz final homing signal. The signals are 
relayed via Cospas-Sarsat satellites, local user terminals (LUTs) and mission control centres (MCCs) to 
SAR points of contact (SPOCs) which include RCCs.

SAR points of contact (SPOCs) which include RCCs.
2.6.2 LUTs are Cospas-Sarsat earth stations. MCCs collect, store, and sort data from LUTs and other MCCs, 
exchange data within the system, and provide alert messages to the SPOCs, which include points 
outside the SAR system where no RCC is available.
2.6.3 Cospas-Sarsat also relays alerts from aviation 406 MHz emergency locator transmitters (ELTs), and

from 406 MHz personal locator beacons (PLBs). Signals from 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz ELTs and 
EPIRBs may also be relayed by aircraft in flight via an ATS unit, but signals from these beacons are 
not processed by satellites and are not part of GMDSS. Some national regulations may allow for the 
121.5 MHz ELT on domestic flights. This old style ELT depends on other aircraft or airport facilities to

detect its aural signal. All 406 MHz distress beacons are electronically similar, the main differences 
being construction, activating mechanisms and slight differences in coding protocols. While ELTs, 
EPIRBs and PLBs each have intended user communities, unintended users may activate the devices 
in an emergency.
2.6.4 Most 406 MHz distress beacons provide a homing capability on 121.5/243/406 MHz; some EPIRBs

may also integrate AIS-SARTs into their designs. EPIRBs installed on or after 1 July 2022 will need to 
be provided with an AIS locating signal.
2.6.5 Most ELTs, EPIRBs and PLBs provide homing signals on 121.5 MHz; some also use 243 MHz and 
some EPIRBs may also integrate SARTs into their designs.
2.6.6 Most 406 MHz distress beacons are designed to activate automatically when a vessel sinks or an

aircraft crashes (EPIRB alerts tell whether the beacon was activated automatically or manually). PLBs 
are manually activated. Some PLB users may carry the devices for use aboard aircraft or vessels, 
though they are not designed to be equivalent to, nor suitable for use as, EPIRBs or ELTs. 
2.6.7 Cospas-Sarsat position information can be determined by several methods. The LEOSAR system 
uses a Doppler plot resulting from relative motion between the 406 MHz distress beacon signal

source and the orbiting satellites. Alert messages provide two positions an equal distance on each 
side of the satellite track, and a confidence level (annotated as a percentage) to help in assessing

which position is correct. Cospas-Sarsat is transitioning to a system (MEOSAR) which will calculate 
position based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival of the beacon 
signal at multiple satellites. This method will provide a single position. Some 406 MHz distress 
beacon messages may also include information derived from the Global Navigation Satellite System

(GNSS). RCCs should consult the Cospas-Sarsat Handbook on Distress Alert Messages for Rescue 
Coordination Centres (RCCs), search and rescue points of contact (SPOCs) and IMO Ship Security 
Competent Authorities (C/S G.007 , available on the Cospas-Sarsat website) and other appropriate 
Cospas-Sarsat documentation for more information.
2.6.8 RCCs use the message country codes to direct them to the appropriate States where information

can be obtained about the distressed craft from emergency databases (if owners of coded 406 MHz 
distress beacons properly register the ELTs); 121.5 and 243 MHz beacons are not coded and registered. 
(The country codes directly correspond to the ITU maritime identity digits (MIDs) used to identify 
flag States.)
2.6.9 In the original (LEOSAR) Cospas-Sarsat System, signals from 406 MHz distress beacons can be stored

aboard a satellite and relayed to ground later if no LUT receiver is immediately within view of the 
satellite, enabling the system to operate in a global mode with fewer LUTs required. In the MEOSAR 
system which will augment the Cospas-Sarsat System, the signal from a 406 MHz distress beacon 
will be relayed through multiple satellites and received by an extensive network of LUTs providing 
near instantaneous notification and location of distress events.

Note: For more information on equipment, performance standards, alert messages, distribution 
procedures, users instructions, and other Cospas-Sarsat related matters, Cospas-Sarsat Secretariat 
should be contacted.
2.6.10 Users of 406 MHz distress beacons need to be informed about how to properly install, register, and 
use this equipment, and what happens when these devices are activated. They should be made to

understand that these are the alerting means of last resort, which should not be depended upon to 
replace two-way communications as the primary means of alerting.
2.7 Satellite communications
2.7.1 Other satellite systems are available which can be used for distress alerting with various degrees 
of effectiveness, but the primary ones used for SOLAS compliance are Cospas-Sarsat and 
IMO-recognized mobile satellite services.

IMO-recognized mobile satellite services.
2.7. 2  Iridium is a system of 66 polar orbiting cross-linked satellites for worldwide mobile communications 
services and which support the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System and other safety services.
2.7. 3 Inmarsat uses satellites in each of the areas listed below. Together the satellites provide coverage 
along the entire equator between 70 ° latitude north and south, and serve aeronautical, land, and 
maritime users.

maritime users.
 – Atlantic Ocean Region – East (AOR-E)
 – Pacific Ocean Region (POR)
 – Indian Ocean Region (IOR)
 – Atlantic Ocean Region – West (AOR-W)
2.7.4 Ocean area access codes for contacting vessels via satellite vary. RCCs must be aware of the telephone 
and telex access codes (similar in use to international telephone access numbers) appropriate for 
their service providers.
2.7. 5 Inmarsat type-approved ship earth stations (SESs) and aeronautical earth stations (AESs) transmit via

the satellites to land earth stations (LESs). Each ocean area has at least one network coordinating 
station (NCS) which manages multiple system uses and users.
2.7.6 A variety of Inmarsat equipment may be used by vessels to send distress alerts, each with its own 
capabilities. Some have a distress button which can send basic pre-formatted automatic data 
alerts. Most Inmarsat alerts provide position data which has been automatically updated, but some

equipment alternatively offers manual updating, which experience has shown to be unreliable.
2.7.7 Inmarsat SESs can handle distress communications, telephone calls, facsimile, data, and other 
general services. The Inmarsat-C SES is a message-only transfer terminal; it does not handle voice 
communications, but it is important because of its EGC capability, relatively low cost to obtain and 
operate, versatility when coupled with a personal computer, and widespread use. Various types

of Inmarsat-C terminals are also used on land by trucks and other mobile units. In addition to its 
GMDSS-compliant services, Inmarsat provides a distress and urgency voice-calling service via its 
series of FleetBroadband terminals. These ship earth stations can connect a mobile user directly 
with a designated RCC depending on the vessel’s geographic position. These terminals also provide 
urgency communication for medical advice, medical assistance and maritime assistance through the

use of two-digit SACs.
2.7.8 New satellite systems are emerging which can relay distress alerts. Many vessels are equipped 
with systems that provide comprehensive online connections to Internet, voice, facsimile and data 
communications for such functions as online email, short message system (SMS), video conferencing 
and medical examination and reporting. These commercial satellite systems are not primarily

designed for alerting, but may be used for subsequent SAR communications between ships or aircraft 
and RCCs or RSCs, or as a link to the on-scene coordinator.
2.7.9 Portable satellite handsets are available which provide voice and text messaging capabilities. Some 
of these handsets use GNSS to provide position information, which may be made available to the 
RCC. These handsets are not normally designed for use in the maritime environment, for example,

they may not be waterproof. They are also not GMDSS-compliant.
2.8 Vessel–aircraft communications
2.8.1 Civil vessels and aircraft may need to communicate with each other if either is in an emergency 
situation or performing SAR services. Since these occasions are infrequent, civil aircraft may be 
reluctant to carry additional equipment for these purposes; incompatible equipment makes 
communications difficult.

communications difficult.
2.8.2 The aeronautical mobile service uses amplitude modulation (AM) for VHF telephony while the 
maritime mobile service uses frequency modulation (FM). Except for SRUs, most small vessels 
normally cannot communicate on 3,023 and 5,680 kHz, or on 121.5 and 123.1 MHz.
2.8.3 The following frequencies may be used between vessels and aircraft when compatible equipment is 
available.

available.
(a) 2,182 kHz. Many vessels, especially fishing vessels, and nearly all ships, are equipped to 
use 2,182  kHz. Some transport aircraft can transmit on 2,182 kHz, and aircraft designated 
for maritime SAR operations are required to carry this frequency. Aircraft may have difficulty 
calling up vessels on 2,182 kHz, as vessels normally guard this frequency through automatic 
means and are alerted when the MF-DSC alarm signal is transmitted.

(b) 4,125 kHz. This frequency may be used by aircraft to communicate with ships for distress and 
safety purposes. All ships may not carry this frequency (most SOLAS ships and many other 
vessels do). If an aircraft needs help from a ship, SAR authorities can notify ships in the vicinity 
of the situation and ask them, if practicable, to set up watch on frequency 4,125 kHz.
(c) 3,023 and 5,680 kHz. These are HF on-scene radiotelephony frequencies for SAR. Designated

SAR aircraft and most civil aircraft carrying HF equipment can operate on these frequencies; 
they may also be used by vessels (nearly all SOLAS ships) and coast radio stations engaged in 
coordinated SAR operations.
(d) 121.5 MHz AM.  This is the international aeronautical distress frequency. All designated 
SAR aircraft and civil aircraft carry equipment operating on 121.5 MHz; it may also be used 
by maritime craft. Passenger ships must be able to communicate for SAR purposes on this

frequency. All aircraft are required to guard this frequency, flight-deck duties and equipment 
limitations permitting.

general services. The Inmarsat-C SES is a message-only transfer terminal; it does not handle voice 
communications, but it is important because of its EGC capability, relatively low cost to obtain and 
operate, versatility when coupled with a personal computer, and widespread use. Various types

of Inmarsat-C terminals are also used on land by trucks and other mobile units. In addition to its 
GMDSS-compliant services, Inmarsat provides a distress and urgency voice-calling service via its 
series of FleetBroadband terminals. These ship earth stations can connect a mobile user directly 
with a designated RCC depending on the vessel’s geographic position. These terminals also provide 
urgency communication for medical advice, medical assistance and maritime assistance through the

use of two-digit SACs.
2.7.8 New satellite systems are emerging which can relay distress alerts. Many vessels are equipped 
with systems that provide comprehensive online connections to Internet, voice, facsimile and data 
communications for such functions as online email, short message system (SMS), video conferencing 
and medical examination and reporting. These commercial satellite systems are not primarily

designed for alerting, but may be used for subsequent SAR communications between ships or aircraft 
and RCCs or RSCs, or as a link to the on-scene coordinator.
2.7.9 Portable satellite handsets are available which provide voice and text messaging capabilities. Some 
of these handsets use GNSS to provide position information, which may be made available to the 
RCC. These handsets are not normally designed for use in the maritime environment, for example,

they may not be waterproof. They are also not GMDSS-compliant.
2.8 Vessel–aircraft communications
2.8.1 Civil vessels and aircraft may need to communicate with each other if either is in an emergency 
situation or performing SAR services. Since these occasions are infrequent, civil aircraft may be 
reluctant to carry additional equipment for these purposes; incompatible equipment makes 
communications difficult.

communications difficult.
2.8.2 The aeronautical mobile service uses amplitude modulation (AM) for VHF telephony while the 
maritime mobile service uses frequency modulation (FM). Except for SRUs, most small vessels 
normally cannot communicate on 3,023 and 5,680 kHz, or on 121.5 and 123.1 MHz.
2.8.3 The following frequencies may be used between vessels and aircraft when compatible equipment is 
available.

available.
(a) 2,182 kHz. Many vessels, especially fishing vessels, and nearly all ships, are equipped to 
use 2,182  kHz. Some transport aircraft can transmit on 2,182 kHz, and aircraft designated 
for maritime SAR operations are required to carry this frequency. Aircraft may have difficulty 
calling up vessels on 2,182 kHz, as vessels normally guard this frequency through automatic 
means and are alerted when the MF-DSC alarm signal is transmitted.

(b) 4,125 kHz. This frequency may be used by aircraft to communicate with ships for distress and 
safety purposes. All ships may not carry this frequency (most SOLAS ships and many other 
vessels do). If an aircraft needs help from a ship, SAR authorities can notify ships in the vicinity 
of the situation and ask them, if practicable, to set up watch on frequency 4,125 kHz.
(c) 3,023 and 5,680 kHz. These are HF on-scene radiotelephony frequencies for SAR. Designated

SAR aircraft and most civil aircraft carrying HF equipment can operate on these frequencies; 
they may also be used by vessels (nearly all SOLAS ships) and coast radio stations engaged in 
coordinated SAR operations.
(d) 121.5 MHz AM.  This is the international aeronautical distress frequency. All designated 
SAR aircraft and civil aircraft carry equipment operating on 121.5 MHz; it may also be used 
by maritime craft. Passenger ships must be able to communicate for SAR purposes on this

frequency. All aircraft are required to guard this frequency, flight-deck duties and equipment 
limitations permitting.

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(e) 123.1 MHz AM. This aeronautical on-scene frequency may be jointly used by aircraft and 
vessels engaged in SAR operations. Passenger ships must be able to communicate for SAR 
purposes on this frequency.
(f) 156.8 MHz FM. This is the VHF maritime distress and calling frequency (channel 16) carried 
by most ships; civil aircraft do not normally carry radios that can use this frequency, but some

aircraft that regularly fly over water do, usually in portable equipment. Designated SAR aircraft 
should be able to use this frequency to communicate with vessels in distress and assisting 
vessels.
2.8.4 Once alerted, RCCs can often help aircraft make arrangements for direct communications with 
vessels, or provide a message relay. An aircraft in distress over an ocean area can be expected to

contact an ATS unit about the situation on the frequency being used for air traffic control purposes. 
If ditching at sea is likely, the ATS unit will immediately advise the responsible RCC, which can alert 
ships in a position to assist and arrange an escort aircraft or other appropriate measures.
2.8.5 Regardless of whether the ship or the aircraft needs help, RCCs can sometimes enable communications

between them by asking the ship(s) to establish a listening watch on 4,125 kHz if possible, or on 
3,023 kHz otherwise. The aircraft will attempt to establish communications on 4,125 kHz, and if 
unsuccessful will try on 3,023 kHz.
2.8.6 If the threat of ditching subsides, or the vessel no longer needs aid, all alerts must be cancelled 
immediately.
2.9 Survival and emergency radio equipment
2.9.1 Aeronautical and maritime survival radio equipment also operates on 121.5 MHz, a frequency which

can be used for alerting, homing, and on-scene communications, depending on equipment design.
2.9.2 The ultra-high frequency (UHF) 406 MHz is reserved solely as an alerting frequency for ELTs, EPIRBs 
and PLBs.
2.9.3 2,182 kHz, 121.5 MHz, and 156.8 MHz may be available for use in vessel and aircraft survival craft.
2.9.4 Many civil aircraft worldwide, especially operating on international flights and over ocean areas,

carry an ELT which operates on 406 MHz for alerting and 121.5 MHz for final homing. SAR aircraft 
should be able to home on this frequency to help locate survivors. Many ELTs also provide homing 
signals on 243 MHz to take advantage of military aircraft capabilities. An increasing number of ELTs 
use 406 MHz alerting signals with one or both of the other two frequencies used for homing. 406 
MHz satellite ELTs offer coded identities and other advantages which can reduce SAR response time

by up to several hours over what would be possible with non-coded ELTs.
2.9.5 Passenger ships, regardless of size, and cargo ships of 300 gross tons and over must carry radar 
transponders operating in the 9 GHz band and have to be outfitted with a radar capable of operating 
on the 9 GHz band. Ships may carry either a radar transponder(s) and/or an AIS-SART.
2.9.6 Passenger ships, regardless of size, and cargo ships of 300 gross tons and over must carry at least

two portable survival craft VHF transceivers, and cargo ships of 500 gross tons and over must carry 
at least three. If they operate in the 156–174 MHz band, they will use channel 16 and at least one 
other channel in this band. Portable DSC equipment can transmit on at least one of the following 
frequencies: 2,187 .5 kHz, 8,414.5 kHz, or channel 70 VHF.
2.9.7 When carried aboard vessels or other craft, EPIRBs can send signals on 406 MHz for alerting and

121.5 and 243 MHz for final homing. EPIRB signals indicate that a distress exists and facilitate 
location of survivors during SAR operations. For this to be effective, searching craft should be able 
to home on the signals intended for this purpose, or on the alerting frequency itself (which will be 
non-continuous if it is 406 MHz).
2.10 Mobile telephones – satellite and cellular
2.10.1 Mobile (Cellular) telecommunications devices (such devices include basic mobile/cell phones; ‘smart-

phones’; ‘Blackberry™’ and similar devices; notebook; tablet and laptop computers using WiFi or 
telecommunications devices either as add-on or built in) are in widespread use around the globe. 
Terrestrial mobile telecommunications devices can provide users with services such as telephone, 
text (Short Message Service – SMS), image (photo and video) capture and audio messaging – called 
Multimedia Message Services, email and data services (e.g. internet connection), and geographical

position fixing and basic navigation capabilities (e.g. ‘Satnav’).
2.10.2 Mobile telecommunications devices can be used for reporting emergencies both at sea or on land. 
Cellular telecommunications are often easily available and familiar to users and can sometimes 
provide an effective signal over considerable distances on or near large bodies of water – depending 
on the location, height and power of the terrestrial aerial infrastructure.

2.10.3 A mobile/cell telephone can be a satellite or cellular telephone. A satellite telephone communicates 
through satellites that can provide regional or global coverage. A mobile phone (also known as a 
cellular phone, cell phone) is a phone that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link. It 
does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator, allowing access 
to the public telephone network.

to the public telephone network.
 Many aspects of the guidance below regarding cellular telephones can also apply to the satellite 
telephone. Cellular telephones work well for point-to-point conversations within range of a supporting 
cellular network. Some cellular telephones can shift to satellite communications when they are 
moved outside terrestrial networks. However, these devices would have limitations in the maritime

or remote environments, and therefore the advantages and use of dedicated marine and/or aviation 
communications and alerting systems should continue to be stressed by national administrations.
 The following are some limitations which SAR authorities should make cellular telephone users in 
the aviation and maritime communities aware of, so that they see the advantages of using dedicated 
systems:

systems:
 – use of a VHF radio in a distress situation for a MAYDAY call not only alerts SAR personnel, but 
other vessels, aircraft or stations within range, often enabling faster assistance from a variety of 
closer potential rescuers;
 – the user must know or look up any needed telephone number if they want to use a cellular 
telephone for that purpose;
 – radio signals can be used effectively to help locate survivors using either land or mobile DF

equipment, but cellular telephones require close time-consuming coordination with service 
providers to identify the cell from which a call was placed (usually a 10–15 mile radius);
 – VHF radios allow receipt of safety advisories, while cellular telephones do not;
 – battery-powered cellular telephones are good for only a limited amount of talk time before 
batteries need to be changed or recharged;

batteries need to be changed or recharged;
 – cellular telephone service providers can deny service to selected cellular telephones without 
advance notice (e.g. for late payment of fees);
 – in disaster areas, cellular systems quickly become saturated with callers, making calls to others 
in the same area nearly impossible; and
 – where installed, cellular phone coverage in the maritime environment can be limited,

intermittent, or non-existent, based on several factors to include cellular tower accessibility and 
orientation in relationship to a cellular telephone call initiated from an offshore or coastal area.

radio systems which are connected to computer servers which record the activity, cell site 
connection and general locality of the user. This formation provides data which is of use to

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-10 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
Search and Rescue authorities who may need to identify the location of persons in actual or 
possible danger e.g. overdue vessel, aircraft or persons on land.
 (b)  Persons who are in danger or overdue, might have use of an alerting and tracking mobile 
telephone app. The SMC should consider this possibility and make enquiries to try to discover

and identify the app in use. Once this is achieved, it may be possible to contact the app 
provider, or emergency contact for the app user, or to obtain location and tracking information 
in other ways. An app is a computer programme designed to run on a mobile device such as a 
smartphone or tablet computer.
2.10.5 (a)  When receiving an alert via cellular telephone, SAR personnel should obtain the following 
information:
 – caller’s complete mobile telephone number;

– caller’s complete mobile telephone number;
 – caller’s mobile service provider;
 – roam number if needed to recall the user;
 – battery level and if they have a backup power source;
 – ask caller if they use a mobile telephone tracking or emergency app. If yes, ask them what 
type of app it is and to activate the emergency alert or locating function;
 – other means of available communications; and
 – an alternative point of contact.

– an alternative point of contact.
 (b)  If an RCC receives a report of a missing or overdue person, the SMC should ask the informant 
if the missing person(s) uses a tracking and locating app. If yes, the SMC should ask for details 
about the type and name of the app.
2.10.6 The caller might be advised to ensure the phone is left on to receive further communications, or agree 
on a communications schedule. The caller might also be advised that the cellular number may need

to be broadcast if an assistance broadcast is made. (Caution should be used in actually broadcasting 
the number, since this would enable anyone for any reason to call and tie up communications.)
2.10.7 Survivors from distressed vessels, vehicles or crashed aircraft may be able to use mobile 
telecommunications devices to communicate in an emergency or call for assistance; or active devices 
may transmit occasional ‘polling’ emissions that could provide information as to the current location;

or, the last activity of a device may provide a clue to calculate a last known position. Therefore, use 
of procedures to exploit location data from these devices to communicate with or determine the 
location of survivors can be important for effective SAR response, particularly when conventional 
means of communication or location information are not available or are inconsistent or inaccurate.

2.10.8  Cellular service providers may be able to provide some of the following help in finding the position 
of callers in an emergency:
 – call trace to the receiving cell while the call is connected, and an estimate of maximum range 
from the tower;
 – approximate position based on the assessment of signal strength or time difference of arrival to 
several tower sites or from the cell phone’s GNSS derived positioning obtained either through

direct means, in which a call is placed by the cellular user or by dialling the cellular number 
of the individual in distress (if known), or through indirect means via the phone’s standby 
connectivity to the cellular network (provided the phone is powered on), which can be of 
particular use in instances where an individual may not be able to place or answer a call;
 – cell tower location(s) of the last series of calls placed by the caller (useful for proximity searches),

its associated traffic data, if available; and
 – notification when a call is made from the user’s number (useful in overdue cases).
2.10.9  SAR authorities should make all appropriate arrangements (i.e. legal, logistic, etc.) with cellular 
service providers in their SRR to obtain the critical information in 2.10.8 in as quick a manner 
as possible and to establish regulations that require wireless providers to provide this information

either through network-based or handset-based (e.g. built-in GNSS receiver) capabilities. Similar 
arrangements and protocols should also be made with emergency or public safety service agencies 
so that SAR-related emergencies may be directed to the appropriate SAR authority along with the 
caller’s name, location, and other pertinent information when and where available.
2.10.10  RCCs should provide all possible assistance to other RCCs requesting information about users of

mobile telecommunications devices that are or may be in distress. This may include requesting 
information from communications service providers in their country on behalf of RCCs in other 
SRRs.
2.10.11  National administrations should consider establishing free of charge, abbreviated telephone numbers 
to connect callers with emergency or public safety service agencies (e.g. “1-1-2”, “9-1-1”, “9-9-9”)

or direct cellular call connection numbers to SAR authorities (e.g. “1-6-1-6” in France and “1-5-3-0” 
in Italy) in order to provide emergency services and SAR authorities with an expedient means of 
notification from cell phone users in an emergency, and to publicize this information widely.
2.10.12  Search planning techniques can be used in situations where a mobile telecommunications device 
can only be located using the terrestrial radio signal information obtained from the aerial site the

device was or is connected to. Where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) information is 
available on the location of a mobile telecommunications device (i.e. the user has a GNSS enabled 
device with positioning service activated), the SMC may simply be able to send a rescue unit to 
the reported position or apply normal Datum Point search planning procedures and techniques 
to the GNSS position. However, information on the signal-derived location may also be a useful

corroboration of any GNSS position. Appendix U provides a process to determine the location of a 
mobile communications device.
 Satellite Communications Services
2.10.13  Many mobile satellite communications services are not regulated for the provision of aeronautical 
or maritime distress alerting, nor are they suitable substitutes for approved means of distress 
communications. RCCs must still be capable of coordinating the response to incidents alerted via

these services. There are numerous non-GMDSS international services (systems) used aboard aircraft 
and vessels for the provision of voice, fax, email, and data communications. Quite often these 
services automatically interface with public communications networks.
2.10.14  Most satellite service providers maintain a network operations centre that is staffed 24/7 . RCCs should 
maintain contact information for these centres to assist in establishing follow-on communications

and obtaining vital data in the event of an alert being transmitted via one of their services. If an alert 
is transmitted via one of these services, either directly to a RCC or relayed to a RCC via another 
source, the SMC should then action the alert to resolve the incident.
2.11 Special circumstances
2.11.1 It helps to have more than one means of communication to account for special circumstances.

2.11.2 Sometimes rescuers on scene must communicate with each other and survivors by unaided voice or 
portable radios, especially if survivors are entrapped, other emergencies like a fire or oil spill are also 
being responded to on scene, or large numbers of survivors are being rescued or triaged. For these 
cases, it may be important to:
 – plan ahead for how responders from different organizations on scene will be able to 
communicate with each other; and

communicate with each other; and
 – when practicable, keep noisy helicopters and non-essential aircraft away from the immediate 
site until they are actually needed.

2.11.3 Emergency plans for aerodromes should include guidance on how multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional 
communications will be managed and carried out when authorities besides those at the airport 
must respond to an emergency. One suitable all-risk methodology used in some States is called the 
Incident Command System (section 1.12).
2.12 Communications for SAR operations

2.12 Communications for SAR operations
2.12.1 RCCs should refer to additional sources of information about the types of equipment and systems 
used aboard aircraft, vessels, and survival craft, e.g. IMO and ICAO publications, government 
communication authorities, service providers, equipment manufacturers, and appropriate training 
institutions.
2.12.2 If they have the capabilities, vessels normally monitor any DSC distress frequency available, as well

as MSI broadcasts (NAVTEX, EGC, etc.). Most vessels monitor channel 16; when practicable, some 
vessels may discontinue aural radio watches and depend more on alarms to make them aware of 
incoming distress traffic. Persons on board vessels or aircraft may also carry mobile telecommunications 
devices, e.g. mobile telephones. These devices may be a means of communicating with them.
2.12.3 Distress traffic, including critical SAR communications, should be sent using distress priority when

possible to help ensure it is noticed and acted upon.
2.13 Communication equipment identities
2.13.1 A mobile station is normally identified by vessel or aircraft radio call sign; a maritime mobile service 
identity (MMSI) number; or a seven or nine digit identity for Inmarsat terminals. Survival craft radios 
use the parent craft’s call sign followed by two digits (other than 0 or 1 if they immediately follow

a letter). Satellite ELTs and EPIRBs are identified by a three-digit MID or country code followed by 
either a six-digit MMSI number (for EPIRBs), a serial number, or a radio call sign. Country codes 
should indicate the State where the associated registration data to support SAR operations may be 
obtained, but may just indicate the flag State if the beacon is not properly registered or coded.

2.13.2 MMSIs are usually assigned by flag State Administrations, and all are supposed to be reported to 
and published by ITU. MMSI numbers consist of three digits representing the MID, followed by 
digits indicating the particular vessel. A list of MIDs is available in the ITU Radio Regulations, and a 
more updated list may be obtained from ITU via the Internet. This can be a useful database when

following up a DSC distress alert. MMSIs are also used in the AIS for vessels, base stations, aids to 
navigation, SAR aircraft and AIS-SARTs. The various platforms can be differentiated by reference to 
the MMSI format and from databases.
2.14 False alerts
2.14.1 False alerts are any alerts received by the SAR system which indicate an actual or potential distress 
situation, when no such situation actually exists. The term “false alarm” is sometimes used to

distinguish a false alert known to have originated from an equipment source intended to be used 
for distress alerting. Causes of false alerts include equipment malfunctions, interference, testing, and 
inadvertent human error. A false alert transmitted deliberately is called a hoax.
2.14.2 It is essential that SAR personnel treat every distress alert as genuine until they know differently.

2.14.3 SAR personnel are often in a unique position to be aware of false alerts and investigate their causes; 
so it is important that records be kept on the numbers of such alerts and their causes, and that 
these data be provided to authorities who can use regulation enforcement, improved training or 
equipment standards, etc., to improve alerting integrity. 
2.15 SAR data providers

2.15 SAR data providers
2.15.1 Although some voice and data distress alerts fail to do so, all distress alerts should arrive with suitable 
identities and position information. Automatic pre-formatted messages should comply with formatting 
standards and be registered with an appropriate SAR data provider (SDP). Comprehensive, accurate 
registration databases available on a 24-hour basis can be critical to successful handling of SAR cases,

and for identifying vessels using electronic radio identities without having to dispatch a SAR facility.
2.15.2 Perhaps the most important elements of the above information are the emergency contacts on land 
representing the craft owner or operator. The value of this information is independent of the type of 
communications involved.
2.15.3 Inmarsat data are available to SAR organizations on a 24-hour basis unless owners have requested an

unlisted registration. RCCs must request the data directly from Inmarsat, or from its LESs if the data 
have been downloaded to them.
2.15.4 406 MHz distress beacon serial identities should only be used by States willing to maintain a 
comprehensive database accessible to all RCCs on a 24-hour basis, or to make equivalent registration 
provisions. Cospas-Sarsat databases normally include the types of information discussed above.

Cospas-Sarsat provides its International 406 MHz Beacon Registration Database (IBRD) online and 
free of charge. Each SAR service has access to the IBRD to obtain beacon registration data by means 
of arrangements made by its Administration’s National Point of Contact with Cospas-Sarsat. More 
details can be found in chapter 4 of the IAMSAR Manual, volume I, Organization and Management.
2.15.5 ITU maintains a list of call signs, MMSIs, selective call numbers, owner and operator information,

and craft communications capabilities, in its electronically accessible Telecom Information Exchange 
Services (TIES) database and in published documents. ITU Radio Regulations require States to register 
MMSI assignments with ITU. ITU information is available by computer using the Internet file transfer 
protocol (ftp).
2.15.6 The IMO SAR Plan or the GMDSS Master Plan may provide information about how to acquire

registration data for various systems, along with the information these documents and ICAO RANPs 
contain on RCCs and SPOCs. If no other information is available about national databases and SDPs 
of other nations, RCCs should consult with an RCC in the State concerned to see whether and how 
the data are available.
2.15.7 Users subject to IMO/ICAO regulation carry, as a minimum, a 406 MHz distress beacon that is

compatible with established international Cospas-Sarsat systems and compliant with ICAO and 
IMO. Non-regulated users may, as a matter of choice, carry other commercially available emergency 
notification devices.
2.16 RCC and RSC communications
2.16.1 National plans should provide for operational matters to be handled promptly at the RCC level or 
below in the SAR system, including making and responding to requests for assistance. Advance

provisions should be made for rapid coordination with other agencies for SAR-related territorial entry 
if necessary.
2.16.2 Telephone and facsimile capabilities are essential for RCCs and RSCs, but other valuable systems for 
RCCs and Cospas-Sarsat MCCs are ICAO’s Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network (AFTN) 
and its more modern Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN). These systems can handle

message priorities, are among the most reliable links in some areas, and comprise an extensive 
worldwide network with terminal connections at aviation facilities near most RCCs and RSCs. ICAO 
has authorized their use for maritime SAR where more suitable resources are unavailable.
2.16.3 Communication links to ARCCs can usually be satisfied by capabilities available to the nearest Flight 
Information Centre (FIC) or Area Control Centre (ACC). If the ARCC is not co-located with such

facilities, additional circuits may be needed to interconnect with them.

2.15 SAR data providers
2.15.1 Although some voice and data distress alerts fail to do so, all distress alerts should arrive with suitable 
identities and position information. Automatic pre-formatted messages should comply with formatting 
standards and be registered with an appropriate SAR data provider (SDP). Comprehensive, accurate

registration databases available on a 24-hour basis can be critical to successful handling of SAR cases, 
and for identifying vessels using electronic radio identities without having to dispatch a SAR facility.
2.15.2 Perhaps the most important elements of the above information are the emergency contacts on land 
representing the craft owner or operator. The value of this information is independent of the type of 
communications involved.

communications involved.
2.15.3 Inmarsat data are available to SAR organizations on a 24-hour basis unless owners have requested an 
unlisted registration. RCCs must request the data directly from Inmarsat, or from its LESs if the data 
have been downloaded to them.
2.15.4 406 MHz distress beacon serial identities should only be used by States willing to maintain a 
comprehensive database accessible to all RCCs on a 24-hour basis, or to make equivalent registration

provisions. Cospas-Sarsat databases normally include the types of information discussed above. 
Cospas-Sarsat provides its International 406 MHz Beacon Registration Database (IBRD) online and 
free of charge. Each SAR service has access to the IBRD to obtain beacon registration data by means 
of arrangements made by its Administration’s National Point of Contact with Cospas-Sarsat. More 
details can be found in chapter 4 of the IAMSAR Manual, volume I, Organization and Management.

2.15.5 ITU maintains a list of call signs, MMSIs, selective call numbers, owner and operator information, 
and craft communications capabilities, in its electronically accessible Telecom Information Exchange 
Services (TIES) database and in published documents. ITU Radio Regulations require States to register 
MMSI assignments with ITU. ITU information is available by computer using the Internet file transfer 
protocol (ftp).

protocol (ftp).
2.15.6 The IMO SAR Plan or the GMDSS Master Plan may provide information about how to acquire 
registration data for various systems, along with the information these documents and ICAO RANPs 
contain on RCCs and SPOCs. If no other information is available about national databases and SDPs 
of other nations, RCCs should consult with an RCC in the State concerned to see whether and how 
the data are available.

2.17 Maritime radio telex
2.17.1 Telex messages may be sent via satellite or terrestrial radio. Radio telex is sometimes called radio 
teletype (RTT) or narrow-band direct printing (NBDP).
2.17. 2 RCCs and RSCs may use radio telex for shore-to-ship distress traffic. Such services should be 
established and indicated in the ITU List of Coast Stations.

2.17. 3 Each station having radio telex capabilities is assigned a selective call number in addition to its 
regular station identity, but MMSI numbers may also be used for radio telex. Selective call numbers 
for coast stations are four digits, and are listed in the ITU List of Coast Stations; selective call numbers 
for vessels (which normally need to send radio telex via a coast station (CS), due to the equipment 
required) are listed in the ITU List of Ship Stations and have five digits.

2.18 Maritime safety information services
2.18.1 The World Wide Navigational Warning Service (WWNWS) is the internationally and nationally 
coordinated service for the promulgation of navigational warnings. Navigational warning means a 
message containing urgent information relevant to safe navigation, broadcast to ships in accordance 
with the provision of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, as 
amended.

amended.
2.18.2  The two principal methods used for broadcasting maritime safety information (MSI), which include 
navigational warnings and meteorological information, in accordance with the provision of SOLAS 
are NAVTEX and IMO-recognized mobile satellite services.
2.18.3  All NAVAREA, Sub-area and coastal warnings should be broadcast only in English in the international 
NAVTEX and IMO-recognized mobile satellite services in accordance with IMO resolution A.706(17),

as amended. In addition to the required broadcast in English, NAVAREA, Sub-area and coastal 
warnings may be broadcast in a national language using a national service.
2.19 Broadcast services
2.19.1 NAVTEX is used to promulgate navigation and meteorological warnings and other safety-related 
information to vessels and may be used by SAR services and for SAR purposes. 
2.19.2 IMO-recognized mobile satellite services are used to promulgate navigation and meteorological

warnings and other safety-related information to vessels and may be used by SAR services and for 
SAR purposes.
2.19.3  Every RCC should make arrangements with an associated NAVAREA or National Coordinator to 
promulgate warnings on SAR-related information. Such information may include areas to be avoided 
or where search and rescue operations are being carried out. 
2.19.4 SafetyNET and SafetyCast Manuals describe the structure and operation of these services. This

includes examples and coding which must be followed for preparing these broadcasts, including 
SAR broadcasts.
2.19.5 It may be appropriate and advisable to promulgate distress alert relays over both NAVTEX and 
IMO-recognized mobile satellite services. All SOLAS ships and many fishing and other vessels sailing 
within NAVTEX coverage areas can be expected to carry 518 kHz NAVTEX receivers. Some may 
also carry equipment to receive EGC broadcasts.

also carry equipment to receive EGC broadcasts.
2.19.6 Normally, the most practical way to handle SAR broadcasts over IMO-recognized mobile satellite 
services is to send them to all vessels within a desired radius of a specified position. International 
broadcast of coordinated MSI- and SAR-related information to a defined geographical area using a 
recognized mobile satellite service is via the enhanced group call (EGC) service. EGC broadcasts can

be made via services such as SafetyNET and SafetyCast.
2.19.7 The use of an all-ships broadcast to identify a vessel to divert for SAR operations should be considered 
as an initial action. It may require time to obtain responses from available vessels, and to select an 
appropriate one or more for the task, and can affect quite a few vessels. Although broadcasts over 
IMO-recognized mobile satellite services are reliable, economical and important SAR tools, they must

be used wisely. It is often prudent to supplement an all-ships broadcast with direct communications 
as a next step using vessels identified via LRIT, AMVER or another ship reporting system. Factors 
that may be considered when tasking vessels should include the location of vessels in relation to 
the incident area, relative ability of vessels to conduct a rescue and appreciation of the impact of 
diversions on the responding vessels.
2.20 Radio telegraph

2.20 Radio telegraph
2.20.1 Radio telegraph (WT) is a Morse Code service. The basic Morse signals are displayed in appendix A.
2.20.2 WT has been a core part of the maritime mobile service since the early 20th century, and will 
continue to be voluntarily used; however, SOLAS vessels are not required to continue use of the 
service. A key value of this service is that it overcomes language barriers, but it depends upon trained 
radio operators.
2.21 Phonetic alphabet and figure code

2.21 Phonetic alphabet and figure code
2.21.1 An example of phonetic alphabet and figure code which may be used when speaking or spelling out 
call signs, names, search area designations, abbreviations, etc., is found in the International Code of 
Signals. There are other versions of the phonetic alphabet which may be used just as effectively.
2.22 Spoken emergency signals and procedural words
2.22.1 There are three spoken emergency signals used by aircraft and vessels:

(a) Distress signal: MAYDAY is used to indicate that a mobile craft is in distress and requires 
immediate assistance, and has priority over all other communications, for example, when a 
vessel has a man overboard, the distress signal precedes the distress message.
(b) Urgency signal: PAN-PAN is used when the safety of a mobile craft is in jeopardy or an unsafe 
situation exists that may eventually involve a need for assistance, and has priority over all but 
distress traffic.

distress traffic.
(c) Safety signal: SÉCURITÉ (pronounced SE-CURE-E-TAY) is used for messages concerning safety 
of navigation or giving important meteorological warnings.
2.22.2 Any message beginning with one of these signals has precedence over routine messages. The signal 
is repeated three times at the beginning of the message. The hearer should listen, not transmit during 
these messages, and assist if possible.

these messages, and assist if possible.
2.22.3 An aircraft commander or vessel captain experiencing a distress situation should declare a distress 
condition using the MAYDAY signal. However, if these words are not used, and there is any doubt 
about whether an emergency exists, the hearer should assume it is an actual or potential emergency 
and obtain enough information to handle the emergency intelligently.

2.22.4 Basic spoken radio procedural words which SAR personnel should understand and use are found in 
appendix A.
2.23 On-scene communications
2.23.1 Besides equipping SAR aircraft to communicate on the frequencies 2,182 kHz, 3,023 kHz, 
4,125 kHz, 5,680 kHz, 121.5 MHz, and 123.1 MHz, some SAR authorities have provided for other 
communication equipment on scene, such as:
 – AIS to detect the AIS search and rescue transmitter (SART) and/or SART-compatible 9 GHz 
radars for SAR facilities;

communication equipment on scene, such as:
 – AIS to detect the AIS search and rescue transmitter (SART) and/or SART-compatible 9 GHz 
radars for SAR facilities;

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-16 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 – disposable droppable radios operating on 123.1 MHz VHF/AM which can be dropped for 
survivors to use in communicating with SAR aircraft or SAR vessels on scene; and
 – radio installation aboard SRUs which will activate DSC alerts aboard vessels in the vicinity to 
help establish communications with them more directly.
2.23.2 The means of communication between SAR facilities and the RCC or RSC depends upon local plans

and arrangements, and on whether the RCC or RSC is communicating directly or via an alerting post.
2.24 Electronic positioning
2.24.1 While information is often received about the position of a distressed craft when the SAR system 
is alerted, many alerts are received without positions or with inaccurate ones. Positioning is the 
determination of the general location or coordinates of the scene of the distress, while direction 
finding or homing is used to help pinpoint the position.

2.24.2 Distress position data are crucial to SAR personnel. Vessels and aircraft use various navigation 
equipment to determine their own positions, and sometimes this equipment is connected to or 
integrated with communications equipment to include positions in alert messages automatically. 
Electronic positioning means include radio beacons used in conjunction with radar, Decca, Loran A, 
and Loran C.

and Loran C.
2.24.3 Bearings from shore can be obtained by shore facilities within range of radio or other electronic 
signals compatible with DF equipment. Two or more bearings plotted as lines of position (LOPs) 
can fix the position of an aircraft or vessel by triangulation. Some maritime SAR authorities operate 
DF services to obtain bearings to channel 16 transmissions. DF equipment can be effectively used 
whether it is fixed on land or installed aboard SAR facilities.

2.24.4 There are also a variety of satellite systems used for positioning. These systems, Global Navigation 
Satellite Systems (GNSS), e.g. GLONASS and the Global Positioning System (GPS), are based on a 
constellation of satellites. They are available for a wide variety of three-dimensional position fixes 
for military and civilian uses worldwide. Three-dimensional capability and accuracy to within

10 m makes it attractive for aeronautical applications. However, many GNSS-equipped devices are 
capable of determining positions only to within 100 m accuracy.
2.24.5 Having a very precise GNSS search object position is valuable, but does not alleviate the need for 
homing capabilities, especially if the SAR facility is not also GNSS-equipped, or if operations take 
place at night or in other low-visibility conditions.

2.24.6 Persons on board vessels or aircraft may have a mobile telecommunications device, e.g. mobile 
telephone which, if within terrestrial mobile phone coverage, may provide general location 
information. The phone user may also have the capability to use an emergency app which may 
provide tracking and alerting capabilities using the terrestrial mobile telecommunications system. If 
persons in danger are within their mobile telephone provider’s coverage area, the app location or

tracking data may provide current position, track history and/or last known position (LKP).
2.25 Codes, signals and standard phrases
2.25.1 Publications which can be used to assist in overcoming language barriers and communication 
difficulties between vessel and aircraft crews, survivors, and SAR personnel include the International 
Code of Signals,* International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, the IMO Standard Marine

Communication Phrases (SMCP) (Assembly resolution A.918(22)), annex 10 to the Convention on 
International Civil Aviation and PANS-ATM (ICAO Document 4444). These documents should be 
included in RCC libraries and be understood by the staff, who should be able to comprehend and 
transmit messages using these phrases. Ships should carry these documents. SRUs should carry the 
International Code of Signals.

International Code of Signals.
* The first draft of the Code of Signals was prepared in 1855. Responsibility for it passed to several organizations until its sponsorship 
was assumed in 1959 by what is now IMO. ICAO and other organizations assisted in its development. The Code can be used for 
almost any means of communication and can overcome language barriers for safety of navigation and during emergencies.

2.25.2 These references are all available from IMO and certain speciality bookstores worldwide. Only a 
few provisions of the references are duplicated in this Manual.
2.25.3 Most ship masters, aircraft pilots, air traffic controllers, SAR personnel, etc., have a working knowledge 
of the English language. However, they must sometimes communicate with those who cannot speak 
or understand English, or when voice communications are not possible under the circumstances. In

these situations, the Code and the IMO SMCP can be essential.
2.25.4 Signalling means covered in the Code include flags (it contains a colour plate of the international 
flags and pennants), flashing lights, sound, voice, radio, hand signals, and visual signals. It 
includes: signalling instructions; general and medical signal codes; distress and life-saving signals; 
radiotelephone procedures; national identity signals for vessels and aircraft; and visual signals with

which persons in distress can seek assistance and help those responding. Aviation air-to-surface and 
surface-to-air signals, and ground-to-air visual codes for use by SAR facilities are also included.
2.25.5 The IMO SMCP is intended to improve safety by standardizing phrases. The phrases of the IMO 
SMCP should be used routinely in preference to words of similar meaning to help their use become 
common and accepted. The IMO SMCP is based on the English language.

2.25.6 With the decreasing use of Morse Code, the International Code of Signals  and the IMO SMCP 
(Assembly resolution A.918(22)) will become increasingly important. It may be of assistance to refer 
to these documents in international SAR agreements as provisions for use during operations, training, 
and exercises when SAR facilities of more than one country are cooperating in response to a distress 
incident.

incident.
2.25.7 While tools like the Code and IMO SMCP exist, they should not be necessary for verbal 
communications among SAR personnel and others who should be able to speak English due to the 
nature of their duties. RCCs should plan to have staff with a working knowledge of English to enable 
timely and effective communications with aircraft, vessels, and other RCCs.
2.25.8 Where neighbouring States use languages other than English, it is useful to have someone at the

RCC or on call capable in those languages too. Advantage can also be taken of the increasing trend 
of communication service providers to offer translation services on the telephone or even by text 
translation on the Internet. Confirmation of verbal conversations with facsimile or other written 
means can reduce misunderstandings, and expedite coordination processes.
2.25.9 A few distress signals are provided in appendix A for emphasis or for discussion of visual detectability

(RCCs should still be familiar with the references cited above).
2.25.10 IMO-ICAO surface-to-air visual signals and additional visual signals are found in appendix A.
2.26 First RCC
2.26.1 The concept of “first RCC” has been developed to show how an MRCC that receives a distress alert 
has responsibility to do what it can to acknowledge the alert, and arrange assistance, until it can 
identify another RCC willing and better able to respond. Section 3.6 provides additional discussion.

2.26.2 This same philosophy is applied when an MRCC receives an HF alert which may have been received 
by other MRCCs as well, or when other RCCs may have also received an alert from the distressed craft 
from a different alerting device. Until it is known that another RCC better able to respond has accepted 
SAR coordination duties, any RCC receiving an alert should consider itself to be the “first RCC”.
2.27 SAR operations communications

2.27 .2 The SMC should select SAR-dedicated frequencies, inform the OSC, ACO or SAR facilities, and 
establish communications with adjacent RCCs and SAR facility parent agencies as appropriate. 
If multiple assets are assigned, the OSC should maintain communications with all maritime SAR 
facilities and the ACO with all aeronautical SAR facilities and both with the SMC; the OSC and ACO

would communicate with each other as specified by the SMC. A primary and secondary frequency 
should be assigned for on-scene communications.
2. 27. 3 The OSC and/or ACO should be authorized to control communications on scene and ensure that 
reliable communications are maintained. SAR facilities normally report to the OSC and/or ACO on 
an assigned frequency. If a frequency shift is carried out, instructions should be provided about what

to do if intended communications cannot be re-established on the new frequency. All SRUs should 
carry a copy of the International Code of Signals  and the IMO Standard Marine Communication 
Phrases, which contain internationally recognized communications information.

2.28 SAR operations messages

2.28 SAR operations messages
2.28.1 SAR operations messages include situation reports (SITREPs), search action messages, rescue action 
messages, “all ships” broadcasts, aircraft alerting messages, and other SAR messages. These messages 
should be unclassified, in plain language, and require no key to interpret. RCCs should establish a 
standard sample message file, or computer templates and programs, to aid in quickly drafting and 
releasing the types of messages used regularly.

releasing the types of messages used regularly.
 ATS Unit – RCC Alerting (ALR) message 
2.28.2  When an ATS unit needs to pass distress alert information to an RCC it may call by telephone or 
it may send an ICAO alerting (ALR) message via an aeronautical communications link. The ALR 
message is based on the aircraft flight plan. If the MRCC or JRCC is not connected to an aeronautical 
communications link then discussion with the ATS unit may find alternative solutions such as a

telephone call followed up by email or facsimile with the ALR message. The ALR message format, 
terms and acronyms may not be clearly understood unless the reader has been trained on the meaning 
of the ALR message. If the RCC is not familiar with the ALR message then it should discuss in advance 
with the ATS unit the means by which the RCC can understand the ALR message or other ways for 
the RCC to get the alert information. Further guidance is provided in ICAO document Procedures for

Air Navigation Services — Air Traffic Management (PANS-ATM, Doc 4444), appendix 3.
 RCC–RCC distress alert information formats
2.28.3 When an RCC must pass distress alert information to another RCC, there is need for consistency of 
formats and styles, for all essential information to be provided, and for the information to be easily 
and clearly understandable. Model formats provided in appendix B have been developed for relay 
of Inmarsat-C, and DSC distress alerts between RCCs.

RCC Cospas-Sarsat message formats
2.28.4 Standard formats have been developed for RCCs to use in communicating with any MCC of the 
Cospas-Sarsat System when necessary, and for the transfer of information from the MCC to the RCC. 
Appendix B contains sample formats for these messages. All Cospas-Sarsat message samples are also 
available in Cospas-Sarsat document G.007 Handbook on distress alert messages for RCCs.

2.28.5 Whenever new communications systems are being developed, or the alert messages of existing 
systems are being modified, the closer the messages can be made to conform to this standard, the 
better they will serve the SAR system.

 Situation report
2.28.6 The OSC and/or ACO uses a situation report (SITREP) to keep the SMC informed of on-scene mission 
progress and conditions, and normally addresses SITREPs only to the SMC unless otherwise directed. 
The SMC uses SITREPs to keep superiors, other RCCs and RSCs, and any other interested agencies 
informed of mission progress. For cases where pollution or threat of pollution exists as the result of

the casualty, the appropriate agency tasked with environmental protection should be an information 
addressee on all SITREPs.
2.28.7 Often a short SITREP is used to provide the earliest notice of a casualty or to pass urgent details when 
using the SITREP to request assistance. A full SITREP is used to pass amplifying information during 
SAR operations, or to inform SAR authorities of the home State of the craft in distress.

2.28.8 Initial SITREPs should be transmitted as soon as details of an incident become clear enough to indicate 
SAR system involvement, and should not be delayed unnecessarily for confirmation of all details. 
Further SITREPs should be issued as soon as other relevant information is obtained. Information 
already passed should not be repeated. During prolonged operations, “no change” SITREPs should

be issued at intervals of about three hours to reassure recipients that nothing has been missed. When 
the incident is concluded, a final SITREP should be issued as confirmation.
2.28.9 While SITREP format is usually established by agency directives, the standard format shown in 
appendix I should be used for international communications between RCCs. Each SITREP concerning 
the same casualty should be numbered sequentially.

2.28.10 Regardless of format, SITREPs usually provide the following information:
(a) Identification: usually in the subject line, the SITREP number, identification of the craft, and 
a one- or two-word description of the emergency. The perceived phase of the emergency 
should be indicated. SITREPs should be numbered sequentially throughout the case. When an 
OSC and/or ACO is relieved on scene, the new OSC and/or ACO should continue the SITREP 
numbering sequence.

numbering sequence.
(b) Situation: a description of the case, the conditions that affect the case, and any amplifying 
information that will clarify the problem. After the first SITREP , only changes to the original 
reported situation need be included.
(c) Action taken: a report of all action taken since the last report, including results of such action. 
When an unsuccessful search has been conducted, the report includes the areas searched, a

measure of effort such as sorties flown or hours searched, and the coverage factor.
(d) Future plans:  a description of actions planned for future execution, including any 
recommendations and, if necessary, a request for additional assistance.
(e) Status of case: this is used only on the final SITREP to indicate that the case is closed or that 
search is suspended pending further developments.
2.28.11 The SMC should develop a search action plan and a rescue action plan as appropriate. In some

situations these plans may be combined into one message.
 Search action message
2.28.12 After a search action plan is developed as discussed in section 5.13, it is provided to the OSC and/
or ACO and SAR facilities on scene in a search action message. Potential parts of the message are 
given below. Appendix L contains an example.
2.28.13 The message should include a summary of the on-scene situation, including the nature of the

emergency, the last known position, search object description, types of detection aids and survival 
equipment which survivors may have, present and forecast weather, and SAR facilities on scene.
2.28.14 The message should include a listing of the search area(s) and sub-areas that can be searched by the 
SAR facilities in the allotted time.

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-20 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
2.28.15 The message should assign primary and secondary control channels, on-scene, monitor and press 
channels, and special radio procedures, schedules, or relevant communication factors.
2.28.16 It is better to release the message early. If a “first light” search is being planned, parent agencies 
providing SAR facilities should typically receive the message at least six hours before departure time.

The message can always be expanded or amended later.
2.28.17 The message normally includes seven parts:
(a) Situation: includes a brief description of the incident, position, and time; number of persons 
on board (POBs); primary and secondary search objects, including the amount and types of 
survival equipment; weather forecast and period of forecast; and SAR facilities on scene.
(b)  Action: specific tasking for a particular SAR agency or facility.

(c) Search area(s): presented in column format with headings for area, size, corner points, other 
essential data.
(d) Execution: presented in column format with headings for area, SAR facility, parent agency, 
pattern, creep direction, commence search points, and altitude.
(e) Coordination: designates the SMC, OSC and ACO; SAR facilities on-scene times; track spacings 
and coverage factors desired; OSC instructions, e.g. on use of datum marker buoys; airspace

reservations; temporary sea exclusion zones; aircraft safety instructions; SAR facility change of 
operational control information if pertinent; parent agency relief instructions; and authorizations 
for non-SAR aircraft in the area.
(f) Communications: prescribes control channels; on-scene channels; monitor channels; SAR 
vessel electronic identification; and press channels.
(g) Reports: requirements for OSC reports of on-scene weather, progress and other SITREP

information; and for parent agencies to provide at the end of daily operations, e.g. sorties, hours 
flown, area(s) searched, and coverage factor(s).
 Rescue action message
2.28.18 In conjunction with the search action plan, the SMC may then develop a rescue action plan. It is 
provided to the OSC, ACO and SAR facilities on scene in a rescue action message. Potential parts of 
the message, similar to those for a search action message, are noted below.

(a) Situation: includes a brief description of the incident; number of persons requiring rescue; 
extent of injuries; amount and type of survival equipment; weather forecast and period for 
forecast; and SAR facilities on scene.
(b) Rescue area: describes the position of the incident by proper name of the area and latitude and 
longitude, or by bearing from a known geographical point; and access routes to be followed by 
SAR facilities.

SAR facilities.
(c) Execution: gives SAR facilities assigned, including facility call sign and parent agencies providing 
the SAR facilities; rescue method to be attempted; aerial delivery of supplies or other supporting 
equipment to SAR facilities and SMC supportive arrangements.
(d) Coordination: designates the SMC, OSC and ACO; on-scene rendezvous time for SAR facilities; 
SAR facility change of operational control instructions; parent agency relief instructions;

temporary flight restrictions; and authorization for non-SAR aircraft in the area.
(e) Communications: prescribes control and on-scene channels; call signs of aircraft assigned 
high-altitude communications relay duties; and any other relevant communications information.
(f) Reports: discusses required OSC reports to the SMC and parent activity reports.
2.28.19 The example search action message in appendix L also generally shows how the rescue action

message should be formatted for the information just discussed.

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 2-21
 Communication searches
2.28.20 SMCs conduct communication searches when facts are needed to supplement initially reported 
information. Efforts are continued to contact the craft, to find out more about a possible distress 
situation, and to prepare for or to avoid a search effort. Section 3.5 has more information on 
communication searches.
 MEDICO communications

communication searches.
 MEDICO communications
2.28.21 The ITU List of Radiodetermination and Special Service Stations lists commercial and Government 
radio stations that provide free medical message service to ships. These messages should be prefixed 
with “DH MEDICO.” These messages are normally delivered to RCCs, hospitals or other facilities 
with which the communications facility has made prior arrangements.

2.28.22 Since SAR services include provision of medical advice and medical evacuations, and since relayed 
requests for medical advice is an indicator of potential need for a medical evacuation, SAR services 
and communications facilities used for SAR should support and monitor such communications and 
offer these services free of charge.
2.28.23 SAR services may provide medical advice either with its own doctors or via a TMAS. (Such doctors

should be trained regarding the inherent risks associated with medical emergencies at sea and 
with medical evacuations, so that these factors can be taken into account in recommendations 
for treatment or evacuation. However, the final decision about whether it is safe to conduct an 
evacuation rests with the person in command of the rescue facility tasked with conducting the 
evacuation.)
2.28.24 There are several enterprises in some States which provide subscription and pay-per-use medical

advice to vessels at sea. However, perhaps the best known TMAS is Centro Internazionale Radio-
Medico (CIRM) in Rome, Italy.
2.28.25 Good communications are essential for an effective telemedical assistance service. Telemedical 
communications are considered to be safety or urgency communications and as such should have 
priority over routine traffic and normally be free of charge to the mariner.

2.28.26 The ship’s captain, who is responsible for treatment on board, must be able to access the TMAS of his 
choice. Choice may be based on his nationality, the ship’s flag and, especially, the language spoken.
2.28.27 Recording of the date and time of all TMAS communications and archiving of secure tape will enable 
essential data to be preserved should they be required in the event of legal proceedings. All recorded

information is subject to medical privacy in the same way as the content of a medical file.
2.28.28 Voice communication is the basis of telemedical advice. It allows free dialogue and contributes to 
the human relationship, which is crucial to any medical consultation. Text messages are a useful 
complement to the voice telemedical advice and add the reliability of writing. Facsimile allows the 
exchange of pictures or diagrams, which help to identify a symptom, describe a lesion or the method

of treatment. Digital data transmissions (photographs or electrocardiogram) provide an objective and 
potentially crucial addition to descriptive and subjective clinical data.
2.28.29 Given the international dimension of maritime navigation, a medical problem may occur on board 
a ship far from its country of origin. In such a case, the master will normally call his national TMAS, 
which can perform a telemedical consultation in his language. Should there be a need, following

the consultation, for an evacuation to the nearest shore, the master will normally contact the MRCC 
responsible for the search and rescue region involved.
2.28.30 In order to facilitate and enhance planning of the medical aspects of the evacuation, all available 
medical information collected by the first-contacted TMAS should be transferred to the TMAS 
attached to the responsible MRCC. This is to avoid any additional teleconsultation by the second

TMAS. A “Medical assistance at sea, TMAS – TMAS Medical information exchange form” can be 
used for this purpose. See appendix R.

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-22 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
2.28.31 Communication between the ship and TMAS can be established via coast radio stations using 
VHF, MF or HF radio. Inmarsat satellite communications can be accessed by use of special access 
codes (SAC) 32 for medical advice and 38 for medical assistance or MEDEVAC. Inmarsat Land Earth 
Stations (LES) normally route SAC 32 direct to a TMAS and SAC 38 to the associated RCC. Inmarsat

can support voice and telex (telex only for Inmarsat-C).
 Commercial device notification (non-Cospas-Sarsat) messages
2.28.32 When a commercial locating, tracking and emergency notification service provider (non-Cospas-
Sarsat) must pass distress alert information to an RCC, there is need for consistency of formats and 
styles, for all essential information to be provided, and for the information to be easily and clearly

understandable. Model formats provided in appendix B have been developed for relay of alerts 
between commercial providers and RCCs.
2.29 GMDSS Master Plan
2.29.1 SOLAS chapter IV requires that every Contracting Government provide to IMO information on its 
shore-based facilities to support ships carrying GMDSS communications equipment off its coasts. 
IMO collects and publishes this information in an indispensable reference for RCCs; its short name is

the GMDSS Master Plan, which is available online in the IMO Global Integrated Shipping Information 
System (GISIS).
2.29.2 An up-to-date copy of this Plan should be acquired as a reference for all aeronautical and maritime 
RCCs, communications facilities, ships, and maritime training institutes.
2.29.3 The GMDSS Master Plan shows for every country: the status of its VHF, MF, and HF-DSC installations;

its IMO-recognized mobile satellite services, MSI and broadcast services, NAVTEX, and HF-NBDP 
services; its satellite EPIRB registration information, MCCs, and LUTs; and which RCCs are using SESs. 
This information is given in list form and distinguishes between operational and planned facilities.
2.30 Supplemental capabilities
2.30.1 Instant-replay recording equipment to record aeronautical or maritime voice communications can

help document and verify information, and make it readily available for future reference and for 
other RCC or RSC watchstanders to hear. This is especially valuable for radio communications.
2.30.2 Telephone equipment like answering machines, voice mail, call forwarding, automatic speed 
dialling and re-dialling, and caller identification can perform tasks which include the following: 
record announcements, invite the caller to leave a message, improve the chances that an incoming

call will be successfully received, save time, and reduce errors. These labour-saving devices are a 
convenience to the caller if the RCC staff cannot answer the call immediately due to other calls or 
duties, but are no substitute for 24-hour watchstanding.
2.30.3 Caller identification is an especially valuable feature for any emergency organization to have on the 
receiving telephone, though it is not yet available worldwide.
2.31 Difficulties in contacting vessels

2.31 Difficulties in contacting vessels
2.31.1 Even with modern communications, SAR authorities sometimes have difficulty contacting vessels 
to verify a distress situation or seek assistance. Reliable shore-to-ship communications is of great 
importance in providing timely assistance.
2.31.2 Under long-standing traditions of the sea and various provisions of international law, ship masters are 
obligated to assist others in distress at sea whenever they can safely do so.

2.31.3 Whenever problems exist which may contribute to difficulties in contacting vessels, they must 
be identified and resolved if possible. When SAR authorities experience such a difficulty, some 
constructive steps they may directly or indirectly take to address the matter include:
 – contact vessel owners or operators for an explanation if a vessel which is fitted with GMDSS 
equipment does not respond to calls from SAR authorities ashore;

– if an explanation for failure to respond to calls from SAR authorities seems insufficient or 
suggestive of other problems, arrange a compliance inspection, or notify the vessel’s owner 
and Administration of registry for corrective actions;
 – use regulations to require all vessels which carry GMDSS equipment to maintain appropriate 
GMDSS watches, and ensure that appropriate regulatory authorities attempt to enforce the 
regulations;

regulations;
 – develop a national maritime education, information, and follow-up programme to ensure 
that responsible authorities, manufacturers, training institutes, shipping officials, and GMDSS 
service providers know, understand, and properly implement requirements for distress and 
safety communications and assisting persons in distress;
 – provide guidance to vessels on the importance of equipment registration, of proper

watchstanding, of avoiding false alerts, and of following up to cancel any inadvertent alerts;
 – review broadcast practices to minimize excessive use of messages which cause audible alarms 
to sound on ship bridges, of message categories which cannot be suppressed by the ship, of 
unnecessary duplication of MSI to the same ocean areas, or of transmission to an unnecessarily 
large area or number of vessels; and

large area or number of vessels; and
 – ensure that SAR personnel have ready access to suitable GMDSS databases to support SAR, 
and access to use of DSC shore stations domestically or through cooperative arrangements 
with neighbouring States or assisting vessels.
2.32 Unbarring of Inmarsat SESs by RCCs
2.32.1 Inmarsat sometimes finds it necessary to bar a vessel’s SES from transmitting and receiving

communications. In such cases, the SES can still be used by vessels to send distress alerts or make 
distress calls. In the case of an emergency, an RCC will initially attempt to contact the vessel to 
ascertain whether the distress alert is real or inadvertent. If the RCC is unable to communicate with 
the vessel, they will then check its status in the MRCC Database. Mandatory or discretionary barring

will prevent communications with the vessel. The RCC may then call its associated LES, to confirm 
the barring status of the terminal. The LES will verify the status by referring to the appropriate tables 
(barring/authorization, etc.). If the terminal status is confirmed as barred, the RCC will then request 
the LES to unbar the terminal so that communications with the vessel can be established. If the RCC is

unable to communicate with the LES, or requires the terminal to be unbarred by more than one LES, it 
should contact Inmarsat Customer Services or Inmarsat Network Operations Centre (NOC), or both.
2.32.2 Any RCC that is not associated with an Inmarsat LES may not know through which LES it is 
attempting to communicate with a vessel. There can be a number of reasons why a non-associated 
RCC is unable to communicate with the vessel, including barring of the vessel or local/national

telecommunication issues. If local/national telecommunication issues are not relevant and barring is 
suspected, the RCC should first try to contact the vessel via an Inmarsat associated RCC, who will be 
able to arrange for the barring to be lifted. Alternatively, the non-associated RCC may contact either 
Inmarsat Customer Services or Inmarsat NOC (or both) which operate on a 24-hour basis. Inmarsat

will check its Electronic Service Activation System (ESAS) for the correct status of the terminal, i.e. 
active, barred, etc. If the terminal is found to be active and not barred, Inmarsat will assist the RCC 
by providing any other information or advice as requested.
2.32.3 Additionally, vessels equipped with Voice Distress-enabled FleetBroadband terminals may be similarly 
barred. However, LESs will be unable to assist in these cases and the RCC should contact either the

Inmarsat Customer Services which operates on a 24-hour basis or the Network Operations Centre 
(NOC), which also operates on a 24-hour basis, who will be able to arrange the necessary unbarring.

2.32 Unbarring of Inmarsat SESs by RCCs

2.32 Unbarring of Inmarsat SESs by RCCs
2.32.1 Inmarsat sometimes finds it necessary to bar a vessel’s SES from transmitting and receiving 
communications. In such cases, the SES can still be used by vessels to send distress alerts or make

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-24 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
2.32.4 When the distress situation is resolved, the RCC should inform the LES(s) and either the Inmarsat 
Customer Services or the NOC, at the earliest opportunity, to reinstate the barring on the terminal.
2.33 Radio call signs for aircraft involved in a search and rescue operation
2.33.1 A prefix call sign makes the task/function of a specific aircraft easier to be understood by other

aircraft and participating units in the same area.
2.33.2 The prefix call sign can also give the aircraft priority in some situations.
2.33.3 State authority responsible for air regulation shall arrange that use of prefix call sign will coincide 
with other national air regulations.
2.33.4 During search and rescue missions and exercises it is recommended that the following prefix call 
signs be used before the ordinary radio call sign or as a specific mission call sign.

“RESCUE” for all airborne units involved in a rescue mission
 “AIR COORDINATOR” for the aircraft coordinator (ACO)
 “SAREX” for all airborne units involved in international/national exercises
2.34 Vessel tracking communications
2.34.1 Various forms of communication can be used for vessel tracking. Ship reporting systems can use 
voice reporting over VHF and HF, DSC and mobile satellite services (IMO-recognized or other

mobile service). Many ship reporting systems use Inmarsat-C polling or Inmarsat automated position 
reporting (APR). AIS uses a time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme to share the VHF frequency, 
also known as the VHF Data Link (VDL). There are two dedicated frequencies used for AIS: AIS 1 
(161.975 MHz) and AIS 2 (162.025 MHz). LRIT can employ any form of communication which meets 
the required functional specification, but most vessels use Inmarsat equipment to report every six

hours to their data centre via a communications provider and application service provider. Vessel 
monitoring systems (VMS) can use various systems for tracking, including Inmarsat, Iridium and 
Argos.
2.35 Additional device considerations
2.35.1 These are additional devices that are seen in the maritime environment including those that are 
classified as a distress signal and/or locating device. These devices can include:
(a) Radar SART (Search and Rescue Transponders)

(a) Radar SART (Search and Rescue Transponders) 
 – Transmissions from these devices are classed as distress signals and visible to vessels and 
aircraft operating radar in the 9 GHz bandwidth 
 – Radar SARTs should activate an RCC’s distress procedures and the appendix F – Distress 
phase checklist
(b) Devices with AIS component
 – Devices that have AIS locating capability include Man Overboard (MOB) devices, 
AIS-SART and EPIRBS. These AIS devices are required to have an MMSI which is

programmed by the manufacturer in a serialised manner. This MMSI is not connected 
with a vessel MMSI. Registration data may not be available but where it does exist it is 
strongly encouraged to be provided to RCCs 
 – AIS-SART (Search and Rescue Transmitters) 
 AIS-SARTs are part of the GMDSS and have been able to be used as an alternative to radar (X-band) 
SARTs. These are visible to AIS equipped vessels, and some shore stations (e.g. VTS) monitoring AIS.

They are designated only as a locating signal and are intended to be used following transmission of 
distress alerting signals. However, as an AIS-SART activation may be related to a vessel or person(s) 
that has activated a device to draw attention to their location because of an emergency situation that 
they could not make known by other means, it may need to be investigated.
(c) AIS-MOB (Man Overboard Device)

(c) AIS-MOB (Man Overboard Device)
 – AIS Man Overboard (AIS-MOB) devices are intended as personal locating devices for 
use by, for example, ship’s crew members, offshore energy industry personnel, small boat 
users, divers, etc. These devices are small, portable and/or can be fitted to life jackets and 
personal flotation devices. AIS-MOB devices transmit AIS locating signals in the same 
way as AIS-SARTs

way as AIS-SARTs 
 – The sighting or reporting of an AIS-MOB signal may indicate that a person or persons 
activated the device to draw attention to their location perhaps because of an emergency, 
for example, a man overboard from a vessel or offshore installation. The AIS-MOB is 
primarily intended to enable the vessel, craft or installation from which a person has 
fallen, to locate them and for other nearby vessels to be able to assist if necessary

– AIS-MOB devices are used by small craft, for example, pleasure boats and small fishing 
vessels that may be operating single-handed or where crew numbers are small and so 
reports of AIS-MOB sightings should be investigated
(d) EPIRB-AIS
 – EPIRB-AIS devices are 406 MHz distress alerting devices that contain an additional AIS 
transmitter developed using the same AIS-SART technology, where the AIS component

is used as an aid in locating that EPIRB-AIS. EPIRB-AIS devices will be displayed in the 
same way as an AIS-SART
2.35.2  RCC actions to consider include:
(a) RCCs should consider initiating uncertainty phase actions if an AIS signal is observed or 
reported to a RCC. This decision should be considered in conjunction with other available 
intelligence including but not limited to other indications of a situation requiring a search and 
rescue response, local experience and considerations.

(b) Dependent on the decision to initiate a SAR phase the following additional action can be 
considered. If reported by a vessel:
 – Details and position of reporting vessel 
 – Range and Bearing of radar SART transmissions or position of AIS-SART
 – Vessel’s ability to proceed to position and ETA
(c) Other elements to consider:
 – When was SART transmission observed?
 – Are there any search objects on radar or AIS in the direction of SART?

– Check own AIS display (if available) for vessels in vicinity that can assist 
 – If further search action is required conducting an electronic search for AIS-SART/MOB 
devices, a sweep width should be calculated using IAMSAR Manual, volume II, appendix 
N-10, Distance to Horizon formula:
Horizon NM =  √

communities to share information, ideas, personal messages and other content. This can raise a

Chapter 2 – Communications
2-26 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
public expectation that SAR authorities, especially for prolonged SAR incidences with news media 
interest, should either provide information to or accept information from social media sites. 
2.36.2 As a loosely-defined collaborative Internet network of hundreds or thousands of websites, there are 
no international protocols or policy to manage distress alerting via social media. The exchange of

information on social media can occur real-time but often there is a time lag as participants enter 
and depart a website and commence and conclude their communication. Also, the large number of 
social media websites and associated time and personnel resource demands makes it impractical for 
SAR authorities and RCCs to monitor these websites. 
2.36.3 The SMC should be aware of the possible uses and RCC workload impact of social media in supporting

a search and rescue response. These can range from the ability of persons to report information 
to family or friends as well as requesting intelligence from the community in regard to persons 
that are subject of a search and rescue response. SMCs should also be aware that social media 
may result in uncoordinated contributions and have the potential to distract SMCs from operational 
response, preventing effective coordination. SMCs should be able to rely on other resources to

manage the operation of social media. This may be part of a coordinated national policy but at a 
minimum should be addressed within a SAR authority’s media policy. Also, commercial industry, 
such as passenger ship and airline companies may be making use of social media and, therefore, 
SAR authorities should collaborate on the flow of information with others that may be involved in a 
search and rescue response.

search and rescue response.
2.36.4 Social media can be effectively utilized for disaster preparation, alerting and recovery, but this issue 
is different from distress alerting. For example, a designated disaster social media website can: 
(a) Support a disaster response when the responding/organizing authorities develop a social media 
website through which all distress notifications are received. (The challenge is notifying the

public of the existence of this specific social media website, and how to navigate to the site.)
(b) Provide relief to call centres during extended disasters which may receive large traffic volume.
(c) Provide additional information critical to those in distress as well as those who are reporting 
persons in distress.
(d) Provide a way for people to “leave messages” that may not reflect an urgent distress situation,

but are still important and would allow SAR authorities to respond when able to the person 
posting the request.
(e) Provide updated disaster-response information on one website.
(f) Provide information on what and to whom changes in situation(s) should be reported.
(g) Provide information on who to contact to receive more information. 
 Note: Care and caution should be adhered to during the use of information and material obtained 
from social media during response to SAR incidents.

2.36.5 The SMC should make use of the capability of social media, as appropriate, but also should rely 
on other resources to manage the operation of social media. Also, commercial industry, such as 
passenger ship and airline companies may be making use of social media and, therefore, SAR 
authorities should collaborate on the flow of information with them.

Chapter 3
Awareness and initial action
3.1 General
3.1.1 When the SAR system first becomes aware of an actual or potential emergency, the information 
collected and the initial action taken are often critical to successful SAR operations. It must be assumed 
that in each incident there are survivors who will need assistance and whose chances of survival are 
reduced by the passage of time. The success of a SAR operation depends on the speed with which

the operation is planned and carried out. Information must be gathered and evaluated to determine 
the nature of the distress, the appropriate emergency phase, and what action should be taken. Prompt 
receipt of all available information by the RCC or RSC is necessary for thorough evaluation, immediate 
decision on the best course of action, and a timely activation of SAR facilities to make it possible to:
 – locate, support and rescue persons in distress in the shortest possible time; and

– use any contribution survivors may still be able to make towards their own rescue while they are 
still capable of doing so.
3.1.2 Experience has shown that the chances for survival of injured persons decrease by as much as 80% 
during the first 24 hours, and that those for uninjured persons diminish rapidly after the first three 
days. Following an accident, even uninjured persons who are apparently able-bodied and capable

of rational thought are often unable to accomplish simple tasks, and are known to have hindered, 
delayed or even prevented their own rescue.
3.1.3 This chapter introduces the five stages of a SAR response, describes in detail the three emergency 
phases of a SAR incident, discusses the first two SAR stages in detail (the remaining three stages are 
covered later in this volume), describes designation of the RCC or RSC responsible for initiating SAR

action, and provides some general SMC considerations.
3.2 SAR stages
3.2.1 The response to a SAR incident usually proceeds through a sequence of five stages. These stages 
are groups of activities typically performed by the SAR system in responding to a SAR incident from 
the time the system becomes aware of the incident until its response to the incident is concluded. 
The response to a particular SAR incident may not require the performance of every stage. For some

incidents, the activities of one stage may overlap the activities of another stage such that portions of 
two or more stages are being performed simultaneously. The five SAR stages are described below.
(a) Awareness. Knowledge by any person or agency in the SAR system that an emergency situation 
exists or may exist.
(b) Initial action. Preliminary action taken to alert SAR facilities and obtain more information. This

stage may include evaluation and classification of the information, alerting of SAR facilities, 
communication checks, and, in urgent situations, immediate performance of appropriate 
activities from other stages.
(c) Planning. The development of operational plans, including plans for search, rescue, and final 
delivery of survivors to medical facilities or other places of safety as appropriate.

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
3-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(d) Operations. Dispatching SAR facilities to the scene, conducting searches, rescuing survivors, 
assisting distressed craft, providing necessary emergency care for survivors, and delivering 
casualties to medical facilities.
(e) Conclusion. Return of SRUs to a location where they are debriefed, refuelled, replenished,

and prepared for other missions, return of other SAR facilities to their normal activities, and 
completion of all required documentation.
3.2.2 This chapter discusses the first two stages, awareness and initial action. These stages can be associated 
with any or all three of the emergency phases of uncertainty, alert and distress which are discussed 
below.
3.3 Emergency phases
3.3.1 Emergency phases are based on the level of concern for the safety of persons or craft which may

be in danger. Upon initial notification, a SAR incident is classified by the notified RCC, RSC, or air 
traffic services (ATS) unit as being in one of three emergency phases: uncertainty, alert or distress. The 
emergency phase may be reclassified by the SMC as the situation develops. The current emergency 
phase should be used in all communications about the SAR incident as a means of informing all

interested parties of the current level of concern for the safety of persons or craft which may be in 
need of assistance.
 Uncertainty phase
3.3.2 An uncertainty phase is said to exist when there is knowledge of a situation that may need to be 
monitored, or to have more information gathered, but that does not require dispatching of resources. 
When there is doubt about the safety of an aircraft, ship, or other craft or persons on board, or it is

overdue, the situation should be investigated and information gathered. A communications search 
may begin during this phase. An uncertainty phase is declared when there is doubt regarding the 
safety of an aircraft, ship, or other craft, or persons on board. For aircraft, an uncertainty phase is 
declared when:
(a) no communication has been received from an aircraft within a period of thirty minutes after the

time a communication should have been received, or from the time an unsuccessful attempt to 
establish communication with such aircraft was first made, whichever is the earlier; or
(b) an aircraft fails to arrive within thirty minutes of the last estimated time of arrival (ETA) last 
notified to or estimated by air traffic services (ATS) units, whichever is the later, except when no 
doubt exists as to the safety of the aircraft and its occupants.

For ships or other craft, an uncertainty phase is declared when it has:
(a) been reported overdue at its intended destination; or
(b) failed to make an expected position safety report.
 Alert phase
3.3.3 An alert phase exists when an aircraft, ship, or other craft or persons on board are having some 
difficulty and may need assistance, but are not in immediate danger. Apprehension is usually 
associated with the alert phase, but there is no known threat requiring immediate action. SRUs may

be dispatched or other SAR facilities diverted to provide assistance if it is believed that conditions 
might worsen or that SAR facilities might not be available or able to provide assistance if conditions 
did worsen at a later time. For overdue craft, the alert phase is considered when there is a continued 
lack of information concerning the progress or position of a craft. SAR resources should begin or

continue communications searches, and the dispatch of SRUs to investigate high-probability locations 
or overfly the craft’s intended route should be considered. Vessels and aircraft passing through areas

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 3-3
where the concerned craft might be located should be asked to maintain a sharp lookout, report all 
sightings and render assistance if needed. An alert phase is declared when:
(a) following the uncertainty phase, subsequent attempts to establish communication with the 
aircraft, ship, or other craft have failed, or inquiries to other relevant sources have failed, to 
reveal any news of that craft;

reveal any news of that craft;
(b) an aircraft has been cleared to land and fails to land within five minutes of the estimated time of 
landing and communication has not been re-established with the aircraft;
(c) information has been received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft, ship 
or other craft has been impaired, but not to the extent that a forced landing or distress situation

is likely, except when evidence exists that would allay apprehension as to the safety of that craft 
and its occupants;
(d) an aircraft is known or believed to be the subject of unlawful interference; or
(e) a ship is under attack or threat of attack from pirates or armed robbers.
 Distress phase 
3.3.4 The distress phase exists when there is reasonable certainty that an aircraft, ship, or other craft or

persons on board is in danger and requires immediate assistance. For overdue craft, a distress exists 
when communications searches and other forms of investigation have not succeeded in locating the 
craft or revising its ETA so that it is no longer considered overdue. If there is sufficient concern for the 
safety of a craft and the persons aboard to justify search operations, the incident should be classified 
as being in the distress phase. For aircraft, a distress phase is declared when:

(a) following the alert phase, the further unsuccessful attempts to establish communication with the 
aircraft and more widespread unsuccessful inquiries point to the probability that the aircraft is in 
distress;
(b) the fuel on board is considered to be exhausted, or to be insufficient to enable the aircraft to 
reach safety;
(c) information is received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been 
impaired to the extent that a forced landing is likely;

(d) information is received or it is reasonably certain that the aircraft is about to make or has made 
a forced landing, except when there is reasonable certainty that the aircraft and its occupants do 
not require immediate assistance; or
(e) a downed aircraft is inadvertently located as the result of a sighting or of homing on an ELT 
transmission.
3.3.5 For ships or other craft, a distress phase is declared when:

(a) positive information is received that a ship or other craft or a person on board is in danger and 
needs immediate assistance;
(b) following the alert phase, further unsuccessful attempts to establish contact with the ship or 
other craft and more widespread unsuccessful inquiries point to the probability that the ship or 
craft is in distress; or
(c) information is received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the ship or other craft has

been impaired to the extent that a distress situation is likely.
3.3.6 Checklists are helpful in gathering information and listing the actions to be taken by the RCC or RSC. 
The uncertainty phase checklist can be found in appendix D, the alert phase checklist in appendix E, 
and the distress phase checklist in appendix F.

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
3-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
3.4 Awareness stage
3.4.1 The SAR system’s first notification of an actual or potential SAR incident initiates the awareness stage. 
Persons or craft in difficulty may report a problem, alerting posts may receive information, nearby 
personnel may observe an incident, or an uncertainty may exist due to lack of communication or

to non-arrival. Anyone who becomes aware of an actual or potential SAR incident should report it 
immediately to the appropriate RCC or RSC if known, or to the nearest RCC or RSC otherwise. If an 
SRU receives the information, it should also respond to the incident as appropriate.
3.4.2 All reports concerning an incident which are received before and during a SAR operation must be 
carefully evaluated to determine their validity, the urgency for action, and the extent of the operation

required. The evaluation must be thorough, decisions must be made, and action taken as quickly as 
possible. If confirmation of uncertain information cannot be obtained without undue delay, the RCC 
should act on a doubtful message rather than wait for verification. Reports of overdue craft present 
particular evaluation challenges.
(a) Communication delays. In some areas of the world, communication delays may prevent timely

reports of positions and arrivals. Trends in delays should be kept in mind by the RCC or RSC 
when estimating the significance of a report to prevent unnecessary alerts of the SAR services.
(b) Weather conditions. Adverse weather may contribute to communication delays or deviations 
from flight or voyage plans.
(c) Habits of the pilot or captain (if known) . Some pilots in command or masters of vessels are

known to react in a certain manner in certain circumstances. Knowledge of their habits, including 
preferred routeings, may provide guidance in the evaluation of an incident and the subsequent 
planning and execution of search operations.
3.4.3 Air Traffic Services Units. ATS units receive information on most aircraft flights and are periodically in 
contact with them. Most of this information will come from aircraft reporting directly to ATS units. An

aircraft emergency and its development is therefore likely to come to their notice first. It is for these 
reasons that each ATS unit:
 – provides alerting services to all aircraft flights known to it; and
 – area control centres and flight information centres serve as a collecting point for all information 
concerning an aircraft emergency within its flight information region (FIR).
3.4.4 An ATS unit will usually notify its associated RCC when an aircraft is actually or likely in a state of

emergency. However, when the nature of the emergency is such that local rescue facilities can deal 
with it, such as when an incident occurs at or near an aerodrome, the RCC may not be informed. The 
notification from an ATS unit to an RCC will contain information, if available, in the order listed below.
 – UNCERTAINTY, ALERT or DISTRESS as appropriate to the phase of emergency;
 – Agency and person calling;
 – Nature of the emergency;
 – Significant information from the flight plan:

– Significant information from the flight plan:
 – A/C call sign and type;
 – point of departure and departure time;
 – route of flight;
 – destination and ETA;
 – number of persons on board;
 – endurance;
 – colour and distinctive markings;
 – survival equipment carried;

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 3-5
 – dangerous goods;
 – telephone number of pilot in command or any other person on board; and
 – any member of the crew or passengers known to make use of an emergency tracking or 
locating app.
 – Unit which made last contact, time, and frequency used;
 – Last position report and how the position was determined (course, speed, altitude);
 – Any action taken by the reporting office;

– Any action taken by the reporting office;
 – Any direction finder equipment available; and
 – Other information.
 An MRCC may also request an ATS unit to provide the above information in the case of an aeronautical 
incident at sea. The MRCC should communicate first with a local ATS unit, such as an aerodrome 
tower. An ARCC, a Flight Information Centre (FIC) or an area control centre (ACC) may also have

relevant information, or may be able to assist with investigations using aeronautical communications 
and resources.
3.4.5 Coast Radio Stations (CRS). When a CRS receives the first information that a maritime craft is in 
distress, it is required by international regulations to relay this information to the SAR authorities. An 
RCC or RSC will often receive first notification that a ship or other craft is in distress from a CRS with

which it is associated. The notification from a CRS to an RCC or RSC will contain, if available, the 
following information.
 – Name and call sign (or ship station identity) of the ship or craft;
 – Nature of the emergency;
 – Type of assistance needed;
 – Time of communication with the ship or craft;
 – Position or last known position of the ship or craft;
 – Description of the ship or craft;
 – Intentions of the captain;
 – Number of POB if known; and
 – Other information.

– Other information.
3.4.6 Notification by other sources. All persons are encouraged to report any abnormal occurrence they 
have witnessed or heard about. Notification that an aircraft has crashed, or an aircraft, ship, or other 
craft is overdue or in a state of emergency, may therefore reach an RCC from any source, either 
directly or relayed through an alerting post.
3.4.7 A record of events should be maintained by the RCC.

(a) The RCC should open a log for each incident to record all information as it is received, either in 
full or by reference to other permanent records such as separate reports, forms, folders, charts, 
telegrams, recorded radio frequencies and telephones, and recorded radar data.
(b) The initial notification should be entered on a standard Incident Processing Form. This form should 
be available at RCCs, RSCs, ATS units, and other alerting posts as necessary. It is used to obtain

the important information at first contact since it may be impossible or too time-consuming to 
obtain such information later. Its use will prevent the loss of details. The form lists the occupation 
and address of the reporting source to help assess the reliability of the report and for obtaining 
additional information.

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
3-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
3.4.8 After evaluating all available information and if an emergency phase is declared, the RCC or RSC should 
immediately inform all appropriate authorities, centres, services, or facilities. When more than one 
RCC may have received the distress alert, the RCCs should quickly coordinate and each should advise 
the other of the action it has taken on the alert. This can be done by any practical means, including

IMO-recognized mobile satellite services or ICAO’s AFTN. This especially applies when an initial 
Cospas-Sarsat alert provides an A and a B position, the A and the B positions can be in different SRRs.
3.5 Initial action stage
3.5.1 The initial action stage is when the SAR system begins response, although some activities, such 
as evaluation, may begin during the preceding awareness stage and continue through all stages.

Initial action may include SMC designation, incident evaluation, emergency phase classification, 
SAR resources alert, and communication searches. Since no two SAR operations follow exactly the 
same pattern, it is not possible to develop comprehensive procedures that apply at all times. Basic 
procedures, as outlined below, may be adopted for each phase of emergency. These procedures should 
be interpreted with flexibility as many of the actions described may be performed simultaneously or

in a different order to suit specific circumstances.
 Uncertainty phase initial actions
3.5.2 When an uncertainty phase has been declared by the RCC, RSC, or ATS unit, the RCC or RSC should:
(a) Immediately appoint a SAR mission coordinator (SMC) and inform appropriate SAR authorities, 
centres, services, and facilities of this action. The identity of the RCC or RSC where SMC 
functions are being performed for an incident should never be in doubt. One RCC or RSC may

request another to assume the role of SMC whenever such a change will aid the response effort. 
(See also the discussions of “First RCC” in section 3.6 and SMC considerations in section 3.8.)
(b) Verify the information received, if necessary and if it does not cause undue delay.
(c) When no flight plan has been filed or, in the case of ships or other craft, no information is 
available on the intentions of the captain, attempt to obtain information from which the route

and times of departures and arrivals of the aircraft, ship, or other craft may be reconstructed.
(d) Maintain close liaison with the appropriate ATS or CRS facility, so that:
 – new information (such as that obtained through a communication search, verification of 
flight plan, or review of weather information passed to the pilot before and during the flight) 
will be available immediately for evaluation, plotting, decision-making, etc.; and
 – duplication of action will be avoided.

– duplication of action will be avoided.
(e) Plot the actual track of the craft involved, as far as it is known, and the intended or estimated 
track beyond that point, making use of all relevant information.
(f) Conduct a communication search including obtaining information about any mobile telephone 
devices, e.g. mobile phone, carried and locating and tracking apps used by persons on board.
(g) For ships or other craft, send an Urgency broadcast via NAVTEX and SafetyNET requesting ships

to keep a lookout by all means available for missing or overdue ships or other craft.
(h) Consider if any person on board has a mobile device and/or tracking and locating app and 
investigate access to this information which may provide track history and/or current location.
3.5.3 The communication search can be conducted by two primary methods.
(a) Attempt to communicate with the aircraft, ship, or other craft by all available means.
(b) Determine its most probable location by:

(b) Determine its most probable location by:
 – making inquiries at aerodromes (including the aerodrome of departure) and other locations 
where an aircraft might have landed or at locations where a ship or other craft might have 
stopped or called (including the point or port of departure); and

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 3-7
 – contacting other appropriate sources, e.g. aircraft known or believed to be on the same 
route or within communication range, vessels at sea which may have sighted the ship or 
craft, ship reporting and vessel tracking systems that may provide SURPICs, and other 
persons who have knowledge of the intentions of the pilot in command or ship’s captain, 
such as the craft’s operating authority.

such as the craft’s operating authority.
3.5.4 When the communication search or other information received indicates that the aircraft, ship, or 
other craft is not in distress, the RCC will close the incident and immediately inform the operating 
agency, the reporting source, and any alerted authorities, centres, services, or facilities. However, 
if apprehension regarding the safety of the craft and its occupants continues, the uncertainty phase 
should progress to the alert phase.

should progress to the alert phase.
 Alert phase initial actions
3.5.5 An alert phase may be declared by an RCC, RSC, or ATS unit. Aircraft can pose added difficulties, so 
if an aircraft SAR operation is probable, the RCC may need to give an earlier alert to SAR resources, 
or advise RCCs along its intended route, or dispatch an escort aircraft (see section 8.2 on escort). For 
aircraft, ships, other craft, or persons, recommended RCC or RSC actions are described below.

3.5.6 Upon the declaration of an alert phase, the RCC or RSC should:
(a) Initiate or continue any appropriate or incomplete actions normally performed during the 
uncertainty phase. In particular, ensure an SMC has been appointed and that all interested 
parties have been informed of this action.
(b) Enter in a log all incoming information and progress reports, details of action as described 
below, and subsequent developments.
(c) Verify the information received.

(c) Verify the information received.
(d) Obtain information about the aircraft, ship or other craft from sources not previously contacted, 
such as:
 – communication stations associated with radio navigation aids, radar facilities, direction-
finding stations and any other communication stations which might have received 
transmissions from the aircraft, ship or other craft. (These facilities should also be requested 
to guard specified radio frequencies.); and

to guard specified radio frequencies.); and
 – all possible landing or stopping points along the intended route, and other agencies and 
facilities included in the flight or voyage plan, which may be capable of providing additional 
information or verifying information on hand.
(e) Maintain close liaison with associated ATS units, CRS, and similar alerting posts so that any 
new information obtained from other aircraft and ships will be made available immediately for

evaluation, plotting, and decision-making and so that duplication of effort can be avoided.
(f) Plot relevant details obtained through the actions described above on an appropriate map or 
chart to determine the probable position of the aircraft, ship or craft and its maximum range 
of action from its last known position and plot the positions of any ship or craft known to be 
operating in the vicinity.

operating in the vicinity.
(g) As appropriate, initiate search planning and report any action taken to the associated ATS unit 
or CRS.
(h) Whenever possible, communicate to the craft’s operating agency, owner, or agent all information 
received and action taken. Try to obtain information about persons in distress who may be 
carrying mobile telecommunications devices. Attempt to communicate with them by mobile/

cell telephone call, text or email and/or contact the mobile communications service provider 
and request information about the device(s) last known location and use. 
 Note: Legislative restrictions may require that another agency undertake this task on behalf of 
the SAR services.

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
3-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(i) Thoroughly evaluate the craft’s intended route, weather, terrain, possible communication delays, 
last known position, last radio communication and operator’s qualification.
(j) For aviation incidents, estimate fuel exhaustion time and note the aircraft’s performance under 
adverse conditions.
(k) Request assistance from ATS or CRS facilities who may assist by:

– passing instructions and information to the distressed craft, or to the craft reporting the 
distress;
 – informing craft operating in the vicinity of the distress of the nature of the emergency; and
 – monitoring and keeping the RCC and RSC informed on the progress of any craft of which 
the operating efficiency has been impaired to the extent that a distress is likely.
3.5.7 When information received indicates that the aircraft, ship or other craft is not in distress, the RCC

will close the incident and immediately inform the operating agency, the reporting source and any 
alerted authorities, centres, services, or facilities. If the craft has not been located when all efforts have 
been completed, or if the time of an aircraft’s estimated fuel exhaustion has been reached, whichever 
occurs first, the craft and its occupants should be considered to be in grave and imminent danger.

The alert phase should then progress to the distress phase. The decision to declare the distress phase 
should be taken without undue delay and on the basis of past experience with similar situations.
 Distress phase initial actions 
3.5.8 A distress phase may be declared by an ATS unit, an RCC or an RSC. The SAR system may be able 
to respond quickly by dispatching SAR facilities and effecting the rescue. If a search is required, the 
search planning guidance in chapter 4 should be used.

3.5.9 Upon the declaration of a distress phase, the RCC or RSC should:
(a) Initiate or continue any appropriate or incomplete actions normally performed during the 
uncertainty and alert phases. In particular, ensure an SMC has been appointed and that all 
interested parties have been informed of this action.
(b)  If normal radio or satellite communications are unavailable or not connecting, and terrestrial

telecommunications are likely to be within range, attempt or make calls, texts or emails to any 
distressed person(s) known to be carrying a mobile telecommunications device.
(c) Examine the detailed plans of operation for the conduct of SAR operations in the area.
(d) Determine the availability of SAR facilities to conduct SAR operations and attempt to obtain 
more facilities if a need for them is anticipated. Check vessel tracking systems (e.g. AIS, LRIT,

VMS and VTS) for vessels which may be able to assist.
(e) Estimate the position of the distressed craft, estimate the degree of uncertainty of this position 
and determine the extent of the area to be searched. If a significant search effort is anticipated, 
use the search planning techniques described in chapter 4 to maximize the chances of finding 
the survivors with the available search facilities. Chapter 5 contains information on the conduct 
of search operations.

of search operations.
(f) Develop a search action plan (chapters 4 and 5) or rescue planning (chapter 6), as appropriate, 
for the conduct of the SAR operation and communicate the plan to the appropriate authorities.
(g) Initiate the action and pass relevant details of the plan on to:
 – the ATS unit, or CRS, for transmission to the distressed craft or to the craft reporting the 
distress or to the SAR resources; and

distress or to the SAR resources; and
 – all RCCs and RSCs along the intended route of the distressed craft as well as those whose 
SRRs are within the maximum radius of action as determined from the last known position 
(the possibility area).
Note: The ATS units, CRSs, and RCCs so informed should pass any information they receive 
about the incident to the responsible RCC.
(h) Amend the plan as the operation develops.

(h) Amend the plan as the operation develops.
(i) Notify the State of Registry of the aircraft, or the owner or agent of a ship or other craft.
(j) Notify the appropriate accident investigation authorities.
(k) Request at an early stage such aircraft, vessels, CRSs, or other services not specifically included 
among SRUs, as are in a position to do so, to:
 – maintain a listening watch for transmission from the distressed craft, from survival radio 
equipment, or from an ELT or EPIRB;

equipment, or from an ELT or EPIRB;
 – assist the distressed craft as far as practicable; and
 – inform the RCC or RSC of any developments.
(l) Notify the distressed craft’s operating agency and keep it informed of developments.
3.5.10 When the distressed craft has been located and the survivors rescued, the RCC or RSC will terminate 
the SAR operation, close the case and immediately advise the operating agency, the reporting source,

and any alerted authorities, centres, services, or facilities. To ensure that search facilities remain under 
some type of flight or vessel following system, SMC activities should not be terminated until all SAR 
facilities have established alternate following plans, where they apply. Guidance on conclusion of SAR 
operations is found in chapter 9.
3.6 Designation of the RCC or RSC responsible for initiating SAR action

3.6.1 Typically, an RCC will receive a distress alert and assume responsibility for SAR operations for that 
incident. However, there may be times when the first RCC to receive the distress alert will not be 
the responsible RCC, such as when the distress is in another SRR. When an RCC or RSC receives 
information indicating a distress outside of its SRR, it should immediately notify the appropriate RCC

or RSC and take all necessary action to coordinate the response until the appropriate RCC or RSC has 
assumed responsibility. Figure 3-1 depicts the recommended actions of the “First RCC” that receives 
the distress alert. The following text provides guidance on the responsibilities of that RCC. There 
should be no undue delay in initiating action while determining the responsible RCC.

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action

(h) Amend the plan as the operation develops.
(i) Notify the State of Registry of the aircraft, or the owner or agent of a ship or other craft.
(j) Notify the appropriate accident investigation authorities.
(k) Request at an early stage such aircraft, vessels, CRSs, or other services not specifically included 
among SRUs, as are in a position to do so, to:

(l) Notify the distressed craft’s operating agency and keep it informed of developments.
3.5.10 When the distressed craft has been located and the survivors rescued, the RCC or RSC will terminate

the SAR operation, close the case and immediately advise the operating agency, the reporting source, 
and any alerted authorities, centres, services, or facilities. To ensure that search facilities remain under 
some type of flight or vessel following system, SMC activities should not be terminated until all SAR 
facilities have established alternate following plans, where they apply. Guidance on conclusion of SAR 
operations is found in chapter 9.

3.6.1 Typically, an RCC will receive a distress alert and assume responsibility for SAR operations for that 
incident. However, there may be times when the first RCC to receive the distress alert will not be 
the responsible RCC, such as when the distress is in another SRR. When an RCC or RSC receives

information indicating a distress outside of its SRR, it should immediately notify the appropriate RCC 
or RSC and take all necessary action to coordinate the response until the appropriate RCC or RSC has 
assumed responsibility. Figure 3-1 depicts the recommended actions of the “First RCC” that receives 
the distress alert. The following text provides guidance on the responsibilities of that RCC. There 
should be no undue delay in initiating action while determining the responsible RCC.

3.6.2 When it is likely that other RCCs have also received alerts from the distressed craft, any RCC receiving 
an alert should assume responsibility until coordination with the other RCCs can take place and the 
appropriate RCC assumes responsibility.
3.6.3 When the position of the distressed craft is known, the responsibility for initiation of a SAR operation

will be that of the RCC or RSC in whose area the craft is located.
3.6.4 When the RCC or RSC recognizes that the distressed craft is continuing its flight or voyage and may 
leave the SRR for which it is responsible, it should take the following actions.
(a) Alert the RCCs associated with the planned or intended route of the distressed craft, and pass on 
all information.
(b) Continue coordination of the SAR operation until it has been notified by an adjacent RCC or

RSC that the distressed craft has entered its SRR and that it is assuming responsibility. When 
transferring the SAR operation to another RCC or RSC, the transfer should be documented in the 
RCC or RSC log.
(c) Remain ready to assist until informed that this is no longer required.
 Position of aircraft, ship or other craft is not known
3.6.5 When the position of the distressed craft is unknown, the RCC or RSC should assume responsibility

for the SAR operation and consult adjacent RCCs along the route of the craft concerning which centre 
will assume primary responsibility and designate an SMC.
3.6.6 Unless otherwise agreed among the RCCs or RSCs concerned, the RCC or RSC assuming responsibility 
should be determined as follows:
(a) If the last reported position of the distressed craft falls within an SRR, the RCC or RSC responsible 
for that SRR should assume responsibility for coordinating the response.

(b) If the last reported position falls on the line separating two adjacent SRRs, the RCC or RSC 
responsible for the SRR toward which the distressed craft was proceeding should assume 
coordination responsibilities.
(c) If the craft was not equipped with suitable two-way radio communication or not under obligation 
to maintain radio communication, the RCC or RSC responsible for the SRR containing the 
distressed craft’s intended destination should assume coordination responsibilities.

Transferring responsibilities between RCCs and RSCs
3.6.7 When transferring the coordination of a SAR operation to another RCC or RSC, the transfer should 
be documented in the RCC or RSC log. The initiating RCC may invite the other RCC to take over 
responsibility or the other RCC may offer to take over responsibility. The responsibility is retained by 
the initiating RCC until the other RCC formally accepts responsibility. All participating SAR units are to

be advised of the transfer. Procedures to transfer SMC responsibility to another RCC should include:
 – Personal discussion between the SMCs of both RCCs concerned; and
 – Exchange of data using SITREP form including full details of action taken.
 – Details to be included in the process of transfer between RCCs should be as follows:
 – Date and time of transfer:
 – From (RCC):
 – To (RCC):
 (1)   Identity of casualty

3.7 RCC procedures for requesting SAR facilities
3.7.1 When an RCC, at the request of another RCC, provides facilities to assist in SAR operations, the 
RCCs should agree upon position, start time on scene, expected time on scene, communications, 
operational limitations, and time of assumption of coordination responsibility by the requesting RCC. 
The RCCs should also agree upon how the SAR facilities will be briefed and tasked. The RCC providing

the facilities will advise them of these procedures. Once the SMC has assumed coordination of the 
SAR facilities, it will keep the RCC which provided the facilities informed of progress.

 Transferring responsibilities between RCCs and RSCs

3.6.7 When transferring the coordination of a SAR operation to another RCC or RSC, the transfer should 
be documented in the RCC or RSC log. The initiating RCC may invite the other RCC to take over 
responsibility or the other RCC may offer to take over responsibility. The responsibility is retained by 
the initiating RCC until the other RCC formally accepts responsibility. All participating SAR units are to

be advised of the transfer. Procedures to transfer SMC responsibility to another RCC should include:

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
3-12 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
3.8 General considerations for the SMC
3.8.1 SMC duties can be demanding. The gathering of information, evaluation of this information, and 
initiation of action all require concentrated effort on many details. The SMC will find the various 
forms, checklists, worksheets, tables and graphs provided in the Appendices to be very helpful. The

following paragraphs provide some general guidance for the early stages of a SAR operation, including 
information gathering and preparation for the possible need to plan searches.
 Information gathering and analysis
3.8.2 Information gathering. To coordinate a response to a SAR incident most effectively, the SMC should 
have accurate, timely, and complete information about the incident and the subsequent status of

survivors. Usually, not all the needed information is provided to the SMC. In fact, the fate of the 
distressed craft and any survivors is often a mystery in the early stages of the incident. For this reason, 
the SMC should initiate and actively pursue an investigation of the incident and related circumstances 
so the needed information can be obtained. Such investigative efforts are often similar in outline

to scientific or police investigations. The SMC should interview, or have other qualified persons 
interview, anyone who might have some knowledge of the distress incident, distressed craft, or the 
persons aboard the distressed craft. These interviews may lead to additional persons, agencies, or 
other sources of information. The SMC should try to determine the most likely cause of the distress,

if not already known, by consulting weather bureaus, ships, and aircraft, and by locating any known 
hazards to the distressed craft on an appropriate map or chart. There is almost no limit to the number 
of possible sources of information or the number of possible scenarios for what might have happened 
to the distressed craft. This means that the SMC should perform two apparently opposite activities:
 – think of additional possibilities which should be investigated; and

– try to eliminate the maximum number of possibilities from further consideration through the 
investigative process.
3.8.3 Information evaluation and analysis. As information is gathered, it should be verified to the extent 
possible and then evaluated and analysed with respect to all the information previously gathered. It is 
possible, even likely, that some of the information gathered will be unrelated to the SAR incident, or

misleading, or even false. The SMC should always be alert for such situations and should assign each 
item a level of relevance and reliability. Like most investigative efforts, the basic method of analysis is 
the process of elimination. For example, if the only known fact is that a distress has occurred, then the 
distress position could be anywhere on the globe. Add the fact that the distress alert was transmitted

by the distressed craft using a line-of-sight communications device, and all of the earth’s surface 
except that which is within a certain range of the receiving antenna is eliminated.
3.8.4 Assumptions. In the early stages of a SAR incident, it is almost certain that the SMC will need to 
make some assumptions about the cause, nature, time, or place of the SAR incident. It is very 
important that such assumptions be kept separated from the known facts. It is always important to

distinguish conclusions based strictly on known facts from those based partially on assumptions. It 
is also important to re-evaluate all assumptions regularly and as new information becomes available. 
Re-evaluating assumptions is especially critical. Any assumption which is allowed to go unquestioned 
for too long a period begins to falsely assume the appearance of fact. If this is allowed to happen, an

otherwise excellent SAR effort may not succeed because the search planner’s judgement was clouded 
by a false assumption being used as factual information.
 Urgency of response
3.8.5 The nature of the incident and the rate at which the situation may worsen usually determine the 
urgency of response. The SAR system should provide prompt and effective assistance to all incidents, 
particularly those involving grave or imminent danger. The time to begin searching may depend on the

amount of daylight remaining. Since the chances of survival diminish with time, a few hours of searching 
during remaining daylight may be more productive than waiting until the next day for a full-scale 
search effort. Influencing factors are the number of SAR facilities available and the seriousness of the

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 3-13
incident. For a known distress, a SAR facility, preferably the craft closest to the scene or the quickest 
response SRU, should be immediately dispatched to confirm the distress position. SAR incidents are 
almost always time-critical.
(a) Survival times vary with local conditions, such as terrain, climate, ability and endurance of 
survivors, and emergency survival equipment and SRUs available.

(b) It should be assumed that all survivors are incapacitated, capable of surviving only a short time, 
under great stress, experiencing shock, and requiring emergency medical care. Survivors may 
be uninjured but still unable to assist in their own rescue. Some may be calm and rational, some 
hysterical, and others temporarily stunned and bewildered.
(c) The probability of the search object remaining close to the position of the distress incident

decreases with time. Floating search objects drift, and survivors on land may be walking. If 
the search object is mobile, the size of the search area must increase with time. Delay may 
dramatically increase search area size, possibly beyond what the available search facilities can 
cover. For survivors adrift in rapid water currents, the best chance of locating them is soon after 
they have gone adrift, while the search area is still small. For areas of high drift rate or whenever

there is potential for an extended search for objects which drift, early deployment of one or 
more datum marker buoys, particularly self-locating datum marker buoys (SLDMB), can assist in 
determining the area to search and for relocating drifting objects.
3.8.6 Initiating the response effectively is of vital importance. The SMC must be able to recognize the level 
of response that is, or may be, required, and notify all who may have to act. If in doubt it is usually

better to alert potential responders early, even if the decision is made later that they are not needed. 
Time lost at the beginning of the response cannot be regained. But the SMC should also consider 
the impact of precautionary alerting on subsequent SRU availability. Crews kept on standby during 
designated rest periods will need earlier relief.
3.8.7 Passing on the alert and subsequent information to multiple recipients is best done by “cascading” it in

various pre-planned streams, so that all who need to know are informed efficiently and without delay, 
and so that the RCC staff can focus on their part of the operation after initiating the information flow. 
It is good practice to use pre-prepared checklists of all who should be informed. Additional guidance 
on planning for mass rescue operations is provided in chapter 6.
3.8.8 Environment-related factors may severely limit available rescue time. Survivor life expectancy varies

with the use of life jackets, immersion suits, the type of clothing worn, the clothing’s wetness, survivor 
activity, initial body temperature, physical and psychological condition, thirst, exhaustion, hunger 
and will to live. Many individuals exceed typical life expectancies or tolerance times. Individuals can 
exceed common life expectancies or tolerance times. (Regarding survival in cold water, IMO provides

more information in its Pocket Guide for Cold Water Survival .)* The following are guidelines, not 
absolute factors, for search planning and suspension. Expert medical advice should also be sought if 
available.
(a) Exposure to the chilling effects of cold air, wind, or water can result in hypothermia, the abnormal 
lowering of internal body temperature. The rate of body heat loss increases as air and water

temperatures decrease. Death from hypothermia occurs more quickly in water than in air at the 
same apparent temperature. If possible, advise survivors not to enter the water, or to get out of 
it, even partially, if they are able to do so.
(b) The warmest ocean water that can be expected at any time of year is 29°C (84°F). About one 
third of the earth’s ocean surface has water temperatures above 19°C (66°F). The term “cold”

can be applied to water as warm as 25°C (77°F); long periods of immersion in water as high as 
this temperature can result in a fall in deep body temperature. It follows that most of the planet 
is covered in “cold” water.

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
3-14 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(c)  Wind is a factor for exposed survivors, as body heat loss accelerates with increasing wind 
velocity. Figure N-13 in appendix N shows the effects of various wind speed and air temperature 
combinations, and indicates the equivalent temperature on dry skin in still air. This emphasizes 
the need to shelter survivors who would otherwise be exposed to severe cold.

(d)  Figure N-14 in appendix N shows the realistic upper limit of survival time for people wearing 
normal clothing in water at various temperatures, where “normal” means the clothing likely 
to be worn in the open in the circumstances; warm clothing in higher latitudes, light clothing 
in the tropics. The graph is based on the analysis of known survival cases and laboratory 
experimentation, but it does not apply directly to people in additional protective clothing, nor

to people who may have managed to get themselves wholly or partly out of the water: both 
might survive for longer times than the graph indicates. SOLAS survival suits are meant to keep 
a person alive for 24 hours in extremely cold water, for example. Neither should the graph be 
taken to imply that people in the water wearing normal clothing will survive for the time shown. 
Particularly at lower temperatures, many people in the water in normal clothing will survive for

significantly shorter periods than the maxima shown in figure N-14. The search planner must 
remember that this graph can only be indicative and that a number of uncertainty factors can 
improve or reduce survival time. It is a decision-making aid, not a decision-making tool.
(e)  Guidelines based on analysis of accidents, together with laboratory-based experimental evidence, 
show a clear correlation between water temperature, body cooling and survival times. However,

it is also apparent that, because of the many personal factors that can influence survival time in 
cold water, including cardiac problems and rapidly evoked responses (“cold shock”) that result 
in early drowning, this time can vary from seconds to days. 
 Among the factors that slow the loss of body heat are: 
 – warmer water;
 – calmer water;
 – getting out of the water, or partial rather than full immersion;
 – good state of health; 
 – high body fat;
 – heavy clothing;

– high body fat;
 – heavy clothing; 
 – survival clothing; 
 – using a lifejacket or other flotation device (to minimize the need to exercise); and
 – the use of a protective behaviour. 
 Among the factors that make a person lose body heat faster are: 
 – colder water;
 – rougher or faster-flowing water;
 – full immersion;
 – injury/poor state of health;
 – use of alcohol, non-medical drugs and most medications (which deregulate temperature 
control);

control);
 – age (children and the elderly are more prone to hypothermia);
 – low body fat; 
 – light clothing;
 – exercising (such as situations where persons without lifejackets have to swim); and 
 – seasickness.
 There are other factors, and not all can be known to the search planner. Those listed here 
indicate the uncertainty that must be allowed for when referring to the graph in figure N-14.
 It should also be noted that the graph in figure N-14 only extends to a maximum water

temperature of 20°C (68°F). Above this temperature survival depends even more on individual

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 3-15
circumstances and a “realistic upper limit of survival time” cannot be usefully determined. 
Search times exceeding 24 hours should be considered and searching for several days should be 
considered for the highest water temperatures. 
 It should be kept in mind that factors working positively on survival times are often unknown to 
the SMC. Some of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

– Near-naked swimmers would be at the lower ranges of survival times. However, in 
calm water there may be an exceptional individual (someone who is very fat and fit, for 
example) who will exceed expectations. If it is known that the victim is such an individual, 
consideration should, exceptionally, be given to extending the search times. 
 – For inshore incidents, survival times may be less because of breaking water and adverse

currents. However, consideration must be given to the possibility that the inshore survivor 
managed to get ashore. Consequently, the limiting effects of cold water cooling will no 
longer be the only consideration and the search must be continued until the shore has 
been thoroughly searched. 
 – For offshore incidents, it is reasonable to expect that individuals may be better equipped to 
survive and have access to appropriate protective clothing and lifejackets. Consequently,

search times for them should be at the upper limits of those expected, unless obviously 
adverse conditions prevail, and should exceed them if it is possible that survivors may have 
been able to get out of the water.
 – Survival time is shortened by physical activity (such as swimming). Wearing a lifejacket 
or using some other flotation aid can increase survival time significantly. Lifejackets with 
a retaining system correctly attached (preventing body slippage) and a spray hood or

splash guard (to protect the airway) are most likely to maximize survival. Survival time is 
also increased by wearing heavy clothing and/or adopting protective behaviour (such as 
huddling with other survivors, adopting a foetal position in the water, or getting partially or 
fully out of the water). Specialized insulated protective clothing (such as immersion suits or 
wet suits) is capable of increasing survival time from 2 to 10 times, depending on the type

of clothing, whether there has been inadvertent water ingress, and sea conditions.  Water 
ingress into an immersion/survival suit of as little as half a litre can reduce its insulation 
value by 30%, and wave height of one metre can reduce it by additional 15%.
 Predicting survival times for immersion victims is not a precise science; there is no formula to 
determine exactly how long someone will survive or how long a search should continue. The

SMC must make some difficult decisions based on the best information available, including 
expert medical advice, and on a number of assumptions and should extend the search time 
to the maximum at which anyone can reasonably be expected to survive in the prevailing 
circumstances.
(f) The presence of certain forms of marine life may increase hazards and reduce expected survival 
time. The SMC should be aware of what animals or marine life may be in the search area and

where to acquire specialized medical help quickly.
(g) Heat stress and dehydration are dangers in hot climates, particularly desert areas. The most 
severe form of heat stress is heatstroke, when body temperature rises. If the body temperature 
rises above 42°C (107°F) for sustained periods, death usually occurs. Dehydration is a critical 
factor both in hot climates and survival at sea; a person without water will die in a few days.

A combination of high temperatures and lack of water will quickly aggravate heat stress and 
dehydration. In high-humidity areas, the water needs of the body are about one half those in 
deserts at equal temperatures.
3.8.9 The terrain may determine the type of search pattern needed and the SAR facility selected. Manoeuvrable 
aircraft effective at high altitudes may be required in rugged mountain areas. Helicopters may not be

able to operate in the thin air and turbulence associated with mountain contour searches. The survival 
kit carried by the distressed craft and the hoist devices on the SAR facility also influence decision-
making. Dense foliage may hamper visual and electronic searches and require a greater number of 
aircraft and ground SAR facilities, and closer search track spacing. The presence of electrical power

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
3-16 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
lines, towers and bridges should be considered when planning search altitudes and areas. Prominent 
landmarks can be used as boundaries and checkpoints for laying out overland air and ground search 
areas. Aircraft with poor navigation equipment and inexperienced ground SAR facilities may be more 
effective when using easily recognized boundaries. The type of rescue team used after the distress site

has been located is also dependent on the terrain. Local law-enforcement authorities, forest service 
personnel, mountain rescue clubs, ski clubs, or pararescue teams may be required.
3.8.10 Weather may limit SAR operations. Not only are search objects more difficult to detect, but facilities 
operate less efficiently in turbulence or rough seas. Knowledge of weather conditions and prudent 
judgement will increase the likelihood of success and SAR facility safety.

(a) If existing weather will not allow a search without unduly endangering additional lives, the 
search should be delayed. If weather is good but forecast to deteriorate, rapid action is necessary, 
possibly in lieu of detailed planning.
(b) Wind, visibility, and cloud cover influence search sweep width.
(c) Safety of the SAR personnel involved must be of concern to the SMC. Low ceilings and restricted

visibility are particularly hazardous to aircraft. If the search is to be conducted where there are 
few navigation aids and poor visibility exists, the SMC may suspend search operations or limit the 
number of SAR facilities. OSCs may suspend the search to ensure the safety of the SAR personnel.
3.8.11 Areas of SAR Action. During SAR operations the SAR aircraft involved should be able to carry out their

activities without interference from other air activity. Additionally, aeronautical organizations and 
aircraft not involved in a SAR operation, need to be made aware of it for their safety. The temporary 
establishment of appropriate areas surrounding SAR operations might improve safety and inform 
others of SAR activity.
 An “Area of SAR Action” is an area of defined dimensions used or agreed by appropriate authorities

for the protection of aircraft during SAR operations. It should be assumed that within areas of SAR 
action special flying procedures relevant to SAR operations might take place. Areas of SAR action are 
described in further detail in volume II, chapter 7 .
 SAR organizations should arrange that RCC have methods in place for implementing areas of SAR 
action to facilitate SAR operations.
3.8.12 Flares. Red flares, orange smoke, and pyrotechnics are recognized as maritime and aeronautical

emergency signals. Reports of flare sightings may be one of the most common distress alerts sent to 
the RCC. When evaluating reports of flare sightings, the SMC should determine the location of the 
flare by carefully questioning the informant and analysing the data. The following steps may be used.
(a) Plot the location of each informant at the time of the sighting.
(b) Obtain the characteristics of the flare, such as colour, intensity, duration, and trajectory.

(c) Plot the position of the flare, preferably with cross bearings from more than one sighting. To obtain 
a line of position (LOP) from an informant, the angle of the sighting relative to a known bearing 
should be requested. If the informant does not have a compass, the angle could be determined 
by relation to a geographic feature such as the shoreline, a ridge line, or a straight road.
(d) If only one sighting is available, obtain an LOP from the informant as described in the previous

paragraph and estimate distance to the search object. This estimate should be based on a 
description of the flare, its observed height, the height of the eye of the informant, and the 
visibility. If the information is limited, determine the maximum distance the flare could be seen 
and extend the search area appropriately.
(e) Check with the military services to see if they had any training or operations in the area.

Information required from informants. To enable effective search planning the following additional 
questions need to be asked:

Chapter 3 – Awareness and initial action
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 3-17
(a) height of eye (for an informant on board a vessel or height above sea level for a person on 
land – this may have to be assessed by reference to a suitable map);
(b) weather conditions in the area (visibility, rain, fog, mist, haze, low cloud);
(c) actions by vessels. If the informant is on a vessel, ask them to immediately turn onto the heading

of the flare sighting (if it is safe to do so) and proceed at slow speed in that direction while 
posting extra lookouts. If it is night time, to use searchlights and/or white flares (if available) to 
illuminate the area and/or indicate to any survivors that someone is looking for them.
 Causes of erroneous flare sighting:
 – military exercises, e.g. dropping or firing of flares, aircraft afterburners, weapon firing;
 – ship lights;

– ship lights;
 – offshore energy industry installation lights or flare stacks, etc.;
 – aids to navigation (lights from buoys, etc.);
 – ascending or descending aircraft (especially if there are airfields or airports near to or on the 
coast);
 – fireworks displays;
 – weapons ranges;
 – fishing boat deck and working lights;
 – meteor showers; and
 – festivals using lanterns or other such lighting.
 Points to note regarding erroneous sightings:

Points to note regarding erroneous sightings:
 – the sky must be relatively clear for meteors and other objects entering the atmosphere to be 
seen;
 – meteors move at high speed;
 – suitable information on these activities should always be kept in the RCC for reference during the 
investigation of “flare” sighting reports;
 – reports of “orange” flares are quite common. These reports may be caused by white flares seen

from a distance. The fact that the air is full of airborne dust and other particulate matter causes 
white light from the flare to be distorted and this then can show as an orange colour;
 – out-of-date distress flares can become discoloured. Informants should be questioned very 
carefully about the colour of any flare sighted; and
 – the wake or streak from a meteorite is caused by the observer’s retina retaining an “afterglow” 
effect.

effect.
 Unattributed sightings. The term “unattributed flare sighting” does not necessarily mean that no one is 
in distress. It means that the source of the flare is unknown. If the source of a distress flare cannot be 
confirmed, it must be investigated to determine the cause of the sighting and ensure, with reasonable 
certainty that no vessel, aircraft or person is in distress.
 Types of flares. There are generally three types of flares available and used for distress signalling:

– parachute flare: Widely available parachute distress flares are used by commercial ships, fishing 
vessels and small craft mariners;
 – meteor flare: Rocket type (i.e. non-parachute) flare; and
 – hand-held flare: Standard international distress flare used by commercial and recreational users. 
Hand-held flares will normally only be detectable by an observer as far as the physical horizon.

 Range and bearing estimation techniques and range tables. Techniques to determine the range and 
bearing of pyrotechnic distress signals (with error factors) are in appendix K (Determining datum,

are in appendix N (Pyrotechnic distress signals minimum and maximum range tables).
 Risk assessment

Risk assessment
3.8.13 SAR operations risks. Safe and effective SAR operations depend on coordinated teamwork and sound 
judgement relating to risk assessment. Saving distressed persons and the safety of SAR personnel 
should be of equal concern to the SMC. Once SAR personnel are proficient in their duties, the team 
leader, e.g. pilot in command, captain, SMC, or OSC, must ensure that the personnel perform properly

as a team with a common mission. Mishaps often follow a chain of errors that can start with mistakes 
made during SAR planning and lead to poor decisions during operations. Team safety is supported 
by keeping everyone informed, matching resource capabilities to tasks, detecting and avoiding errors 
early, following standard procedures, and adjusting to non-standard activities.
(a) All reasonable action should be taken to locate distressed persons, determine their status, and

effect their rescue. However, the risks inherent in any SAR response must be considered against 
the chances for success and the safety of SAR personnel.
(b) The search or rescue action plan provided by the SMC is guidance for the OSC and SAR facilities 
on scene. The OSC may adjust the action plan based on the situation on scene; however, when 
practicable, the OSC should only vary facility tasking after consultation with the SMC. SAR

facilities should keep the OSC advised of any difficulties encountered.
3.8.14 Efficient response to incidents requires good situational awareness and effective communication 
processes between all parties involved. Dynamic risk assessment is required, with assessment of the 
safety level on scene based on the different threat factors identified.
3.8.15 This assessment should be repeated as necessary during the response. Changes in the threat factors

and their severity indicate how the situation is evolving and thus provide important information for the 
responsible RCC and other organizations and participating units.
3.8.16 Available facilities. SMCs must be constantly aware of the status of all available facilities. Lack of SAR 
resources can be caused by crew fatigue, need for SRU maintenance, or involvement in another 
operation. A system for monitoring the status of all SRUs should be available to each SMC.

3.8.17 Re-evaluation of initial incident data. The SMC should remain constantly alert to new developments 
affecting conclusions and assumptions. When time is critical, SRUs may be immediately dispatched 
with incomplete information. Therefore, SMCs should seek additional data to verify the information 
used to establish the distress location. Since trauma and shock can distort factual observation and

memory, accounts by on-scene witnesses should be verified. Independent witness reports, SAR facility 
observations, current charts and tables, and radio logs are also helpful. The SMC should use the new 
information to review and revise, as necessary, the current assumptions.

Search planning and evaluation concepts
4.1 Overview
4.1.1 The objective of this chapter is to describe some basic concepts of search theory in understandable 
terms. This knowledge will make the detailed search planning worksheets and procedures in 
appendices K and L and the graphs and tables in appendix N more meaningful. All of the basic search

theory concepts are described in this chapter. Practical examples are provided for each concept, 
showing how it may be applied to the search planning problem. These examples require only basic 
arithmetic skills and an understanding of the basic probability concepts encountered in everyday 
life. Although search planning is sometimes perceived to be complex, each step is relatively simple. 
Practice and perseverance in proceeding through all the steps will enable the search planner to

make the most effective use of the available search facilities. The worksheets and instructions in 
appendices K and L summarize the search planning procedures without all of the accompanying 
explanations provided in this chapter. Examples provided later in this chapter will help the reader to 
understand how the theory is applied.
4.1.2 Search planning involves the following steps:
 – evaluating the situation, including the results of any previous searching;

– estimating the distress incident location and probable error of that location;
 – estimating the survivors’ post-distress movements and probable error of that estimate;
 – using these results to estimate the most probable location (datum*) of survivors and the uncertainty 
(probable error of position) about that location;
 – determining the best way to use the available search facilities so the chances of finding the 
survivors are maximized (optimal search effort allocation);

– defining search sub-areas and search patterns for assignment to specific search facilities;
 – providing a search action plan that includes a current description of the situation, search 
object description(s), specific search responsibilities to search facilities, on-scene coordination 
instructions, and search facility reporting requirements.
  These steps are repeated until either the survivors are located or evaluation of the situation shows that 
further searching would be futile.

further searching would be futile.
4.1.3 This chapter describes the basic concepts underlying the first five steps listed above. Chapter 5, where 
detailed planning for the conduct and coordination of search operations is discussed, covers the last 
two steps.
4.1.4  The methods given in this chapter and in chapter 5 have been simplified for manual use. A computer 
program can be developed based on this manual solution which could save time and reduce the

chance of mathematical errors but the search plans would not be any better than the results produced 
by hand. Computers, including typical personal computers and laptops, have large computing and 
* The term datum is used extensively in this chapter to mean a geographic point (or set of points), line, or area used as a reference in 
search planning. This term, with a similar definition, is also used in surveying, mapping, and geology.

data storage capability and can be programmed to use advanced simulation techniques. Search plans 
produced by simulation techniques can be significantly better than those produced by the correct 
application of the methods contained within this Manual. Appendix P describes some of the functions 
a computer-based search planning aid should provide.
4.2 Evaluating the situation

4.2 Evaluating the situation
4.2.1 Searching is the most expensive, risky, and complex aspect of the SAR system. Often, it is also the 
only way survivors may be located and assisted. Before a search is undertaken and at frequent 
intervals during its progress, all information received must be carefully analysed and evaluated. The 
primary concerns are ensuring all clues about the survivors’ probable status and location are properly

evaluated, and ensuring the safety of the search facilities and their crews. Some of the clues which 
may indicate the survivors’ location or situation include:
(a) Intentions. The intended route of the distressed craft is always an important clue to the probable 
location of the distress incident. Even when the distressed craft is able to transmit its position, 
comparison with the intended route can be an important indicator. If the position is close to

where the craft intended to be at that time, the search planner should place a high level of 
confidence in it. However, if the position does not agree with the craft’s intentions, then other 
possibilities need to be investigated. For example, the distress position may have been garbled 
in transmission, or digits may have been transposed when it was copied or transcribed for relay 
to the RCC. In another possible scenario, the craft may have changed its intended route in an

attempt to avoid a hazard or get to a place of safety.
(b) Last known position (LKP). The craft’s last known position and its associated time is an important 
clue because it eliminates all the possibilities associated with earlier times. It is also an indicator 
of how well the craft was following its intended route and its true rate of progress up to that 
point. If the time of the distress is known, but not the position, this information allows the search

planner to make a better estimate of the distress location.
(c) Hazards. Another clue to the distress location and time is any available information about 
hazards along the craft’s intended route. One of the most common hazards is adverse weather 
conditions. Careful estimates of the craft’s pre-distress motion coupled with information about 
the movements and intensity of weather fronts, storms, etc., may allow the search planner to

estimate the probable location and time of the distress incident.
(d) Condition and capability. The airworthiness or seaworthiness of the craft may be an indicator 
of whether the craft is likely to have suffered a casualty that would slow its progress or cause 
a change in plans. It is also an indicator of how well the craft may be able to handle adverse 
weather conditions. The type and condition of navigation aids is an indicator of how well the

craft could maintain its intended track and whether it was likely to get lost or encounter a known 
hazard unexpectedly. The availability, type, and condition of survival craft (such as liferafts) 
provides a clue about post-distress survivor movements.
(e) Crew behaviour. The experience, training, habits, medical condition, and probable actions of the 
craft’s crew provide clues about both pre- and post-distress behaviour, which, when analysed

with other clues, may provide better estimates of the time and location of the distress incident 
and any subsequent voluntary survivor movements.
(f) On-scene environmental conditions. Conditions at the scene provide clues about the continued 
survival of the distressed persons. Such things as temperature extremes, availability of potable 
water, or presence of dangerous animals should be considered. On-scene conditions can also

affect post-distress movements. Survivors on land may move away from the distress scene to 
seek shelter, water, avoid or escape local dangers, etc. Survivors at sea will drift away from the 
distress scene under the influence of local winds and currents.
(g) Results of previous searching. When search results are negative, that is, when searching was 
done but the survivors were not located, the impact on the search planning process is not

obvious. However, as discussed in sections 4.6 and 4.7 below, negative search results do provide 
important clues which may help locate the survivors in later searches.
4.2.1bis   Accounting for everyone at risk requires great care in any SAR operation. This is particularly so 
in complex situations such as mass rescue operations (see chapter 6). In many cases, especially 
in the early stages of the SAR response, it may not be clear how many people are at risk, and

accounting for everyone involved (including deployed responders) can be very difficult. It follows 
that search action will be needed wherever there is a risk that anyone involved will not be located 
quickly. The search should be continued until everyone has been accounted for or there is no longer 
hope of finding further survivors. The operational area should be carefully monitored and should

be contained, to guard against people leaving it unnoticed. In maritime situations, units should be 
stationed down-drift.
4.2.2 The many diverse criteria involved in estimating the likely location(s) and condition(s) of the survivors 
make it impossible to give detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to make such estimates. Sound 
judgement and careful analysis of all available clues are therefore required to produce a valid 
assessment on which to base a search.

assessment on which to base a search.
4.3 Estimating the distress incident location
4.3.1 The first step in either marine or land search planning is to determine the limits of the area containing 
all possible survivor locations. This is usually done by determining the maximum distance the survivors 
could have travelled between the time of their LKP and the known or assumed time of the distress

incident, and drawing a circle of that radius around the LKP . Knowing the extreme limits of possible 
locations allows the search planner to determine where to seek further information related to the 
missing craft or persons and whether an incoming report might apply to the incident. However, 
systematic search of such a large area is normally not practical. Therefore, the next step is to develop

one or more scenarios, or sets of known facts plus some carefully considered assumptions, describing 
what may have happened to the survivors since they were last known to be safe. Each scenario must 
be consistent with the known facts of the case, have a high likelihood of being true, and allow the 
search planner to establish a corresponding geographic reference, or datum, for the survivors’ most 
probable location.

probable location.
 Note: It is important throughout the case to distinguish conclusions based strictly on known facts from 
those based partially on assumptions. It is also important to re-evaluate all scenarios and assumptions 
regularly and as new information becomes available. Re-evaluating assumptions is especially critical. 
Any assumption which is allowed to go unquestioned for too long a period begins to falsely assume

the appearance of fact. If this is allowed to happen, an otherwise excellent search effort may not 
succeed because the search planner’s judgement was clouded by a false assumption being used as 
factual information.
4.3.2 A datum may be a point (or set of points), line, or area. The datum for the initial distress incident is 
first estimated from the known facts of the case, and possibly some assumptions which have a high

likelihood of being true. Appendix K contains guidance for estimating the distress incident time and 
location. This datum for the distress incident is then adjusted to account for estimates of post-distress 
survivor motion and a new datum on which to base a search is computed. Finally, the level of 
uncertainty about the new datum is evaluated and limits are estimated for the smallest area containing

all possible locations consistent with the scenario on which the new datum is based. This area is 
called the “possibility area” for that scenario.
 Distribution of possible search object locations
4.3.3 The distribution of search object location probabilities within the possibility area is an important 
consideration in search planning because it affects how the available search facilities should be

deployed. Possibility areas may be centred upon a single datum point, centred along a datum line, or 
defined by a geometric figure or figures covering some portion of the earth’s surface.
(a) The location probabilities may be evenly distributed throughout the possibility area, or there 
may be some sub-areas which are more likely to contain the search object than others. When 
the available clues do not provide a clear indication of which sub-areas are more probable and

4.3.3 The distribution of search object location probabilities within the possibility area is an important 
consideration in search planning because it affects how the available search facilities should be 
deployed. Possibility areas may be centred upon a single datum point, centred along a datum line, or 
defined by a geometric figure or figures covering some portion of the earth’s surface.

(a) The location probabilities may be evenly distributed throughout the possibility area, or there 
may be some sub-areas which are more likely to contain the search object than others. When 
the available clues do not provide a clear indication of which sub-areas are more probable and

4-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
which are less probable, then distress incident, search object, and survivor location probability 
distributions* may be estimated by assuming a standard distribution.
(b) The two types of standard distributions most frequently used are those based on the standard 
normal distribution† (bell curve) and those based on the uniform distribution. For datum points

and lines, appropriate variations on the standard normal distribution are usually used. For datum 
areas, a uniform distribution is most often used. However, when enough information is available, 
the search planner’s analysis and judgement will often produce a better, and in some ways 
a less complicated, generalized distribution. Use of these distributions is discussed further in 
sections 4.6 and 4.7 .
 Initial distress incident location probability distributions

4.3.4 Several types of probability distribution are described and illustrated below. In the graphic 
representations, peaks represent locations where the probability density (amount of probability per 
unit area) is highest. There are basically three types of information which may be available about the 
location of a distress incident.
(a) Point. This is the simplest and most specific type. It may be specified by latitude and longitude, range

and bearing from a known point, or other method for specifying a geographic position. It is usually 
obtained from either the distressed craft itself or from external position-fixing equipment (such as 
two or more lines of bearing from independent direction-finding stations or positions provided 
by satellites, e.g. Cospas-Sarsat or from information obtained about mobile telecommunications 
device location and/or activity). If the time of the incident is known but not the datum, the incident

position may be estimated based on the LKP and the craft’s intentions. The distribution of incident 
location probabilities is generally assumed to be that given by a circular normal probability density 
function. Under this assumption, the probability density is highest near datum and decreases 
as the distance from datum increases. The incident’s probable position error ( X) (discussed in 
paragraph 4.3.5) is defined to be the radius of the circle having a 50% chance of containing the

actual location of the incident. A circle with three times this radius would contain virtually all 
possible incident locations. Figure 4-1 illustrates the graphs of a circular normal distribution in 
a three-dimensional view where the vertical axis represents probability density, and also as a 
contour graph (similar to a topographic map of mountainous terrain).
(a) (b)
Figure 4-1 – Probability density distribution for a point datum with top view

(b) Line. This can be either an intended or assumed track line or a line of bearing (such as that 
obtained from direction-finding equipment). The distribution of possible incident locations is 
generally assumed to be more concentrated near the line and less concentrated farther away. 
Specifically, the distribution of possible incident locations on either side of the line is assumed to 
follow a normal distribution. The distribution along the line is generally assumed to be uniform

unless there is specific information favouring one part of the line over another. Figure 4-2 
illustrates the graphs of a typical line-centred normal distribution. Figure 4-3 shows how a line 
* The terms probability distribution, probability density, and density are often used interchangeably in the literature of applied statistics. 
No formal training in probability theory or statistics is required for using the procedures described in this volume.

† The standard normal distribution (also called the “bell curve” because of its shape or the “gaussian distribution” after the German 
mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss) is defined by a specific mathematical function. It has been found through experience that most 
errors of measurement and a large variety of physical observations have approximately normal distributions. In fact, its frequent 
appearance in nature is the reason this particular distribution is called “normal”.

datum of equal length connecting two point datums would look. In the centre it is essentially 
identical to the line-centred datum of figure 4-2. Usually, the distribution depicted by figure 4-2 
will be used for a line datum regardless of whether it connects datum points. Doing this makes 
the computations simpler but still provides a near-optimal result.

(c) Area. This can be a fishing area or other area of operation. Generally, possible incident locations 
within such an area are assumed to be evenly distributed (uniform distribution) unless there is specific

information which favours some parts of the area over others (generalized distribution). Figure 4-4 
illustrates a uniform distribution over an area. Figure 4-5 illustrates a generalized distribution.

 Incident position error (X)
4.3.5 Even when a specific position is reported, some allowance for position error must be made, based 
upon the navigational capabilities of the reporting source or the position-fixing estimates used by the 
SMC, e.g. EPIRB, Satcom, radio direction-finding fix, position reports, mobile telecommunications

devices location data, etc. and the distance travelled since the last navigational fix. The probable error 
of position is the radius of a circle having a 50% chance of containing the actual incident position. 
Guidance is provided in tables N-1 through N-3 for estimating the size of probable position error for 
different types of craft and navigation equipment.
4.4 Survivor motion after the distress incident

4.4 Survivor motion after the distress incident
4.4.1 Survivors of a distress incident may move away from the location where the incident occurred before 
assistance arrives. Aircraft can glide a considerable distance following an engine failure. A pilot may 
bail out and parachute to the ground, drifting some distance during the descent. Movement of survivors 
on land will be largely affected by their condition, their knowledge of survival skills, the terrain, and

possibly the weather conditions. They may move away from the scene in search of water, shelter, food, 
or human habitation. For aircraft incidents over land, it is usually best to first locate the site of the 
forced landing or crash and then search for survivors in the surrounding area. Survivors on the ocean 
usually cannot remain at the scene unless their survival craft has an anchor and the water is shallow

enough to use it. Without an anchor or in deep water, the survivors drift with the winds and water 
currents, although they may affect their motion with a drogue or sail on their survival craft. Drift in the 
marine environment is discussed below. Procedures and worksheets for estimating a new maritime 
datum position from an old one based on survival craft drift are provided in appendix K of this volume.
 Aeronautical drift

Aeronautical drift
4.4.2 When an aircraft experiences a casualty, such as an engine failure, which makes further flight unsafe or 
impossible, the pilot will normally attempt to descend in the safest possible manner by either gliding, 
using a parachute, or using a combination of these two methods. Appendix K contains worksheets for 
computing aeronautical drift in these situations and appendix N contains graphs and parachute drift 
tables for use with these worksheets.

tables for use with these worksheets.
(a) Gliding. The safest descent may involve gliding or flying at greatly reduced power toward the 
most suitable available site for a forced, off-aerodrome landing. Aircraft can glide a considerable 
distance. The key factors are power-off rate of descent, glide airspeed, and height above the 
surface. Since glide ratios vary widely, the manufacturer of the distressed aircraft or pilots

experienced with that type of aircraft should be consulted regarding glide and forced landing 
characteristics.
(b) Parachute drift. If parachutes are available, the pilot in command may elect to use this method 
of descent. This situation is rare in civil aviation but more common in military aviation. If the 
survivors leave the aircraft while it is still airborne, their landing site and the crash site of the aircraft

may be widely separated from each other and from the bailout position. Drift characteristics 
for modern civilian parachutes can vary widely. For civilian cases, the manufacturer of the 
parachute or another knowledgeable source should be consulted for the information needed to 
determine how far the survivor(s) may have drifted during descent.
 Maritime drift
4.4.3 Two types of forces cause survival craft on the ocean to move or drift: wind and current. To compute

the area where the survivors may be located, it is necessary to estimate the rate and direction of 
drift. This requires estimates of the winds and currents in and around the area containing the possible 
distress locations. The two components of drift are leeway and total water current (TWC).
(a) Leeway (LW). The force of the wind against the exposed surfaces of the craft causes it to move 
through the water in a generally downwind direction. This is called leeway. A drogue (sea anchor)

may be deployed to decrease the rate of leeway. The shapes of the exposed and underwater

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 4-7
surfaces can affect the rate of leeway and cause the leeway direction to diverge to the left or 
the right of the downwind direction. (The average angle between the search object’s leeway 
direction and the downwind direction is known as the leeway divergence angle). Whether the 
craft’s leeway will diverge to the left or the right is unknown. This uncertainty requires that

both possibilities be considered. Estimates of wind direction and speed may be obtained from 
direct observation at the scene, output from computer models used for weather prediction, 
local weather bureaus and, as a last resort, wind roses on pilot charts. Leeway rates and leeway 
directions may be computed from leeway graphs provided in appendix N using the procedures 
provided with the Leeway worksheet in appendix K.

provided with the Leeway worksheet in appendix K.
(b) Total water current (TWC) can have several components. Some or all of the following may be 
included:
(1) Sea current (SC). This is the main large-scale flow of ocean waters. Sea currents near the 
surface are of principal interest to search planners. Near shore or in shallow waters, sea 
current is usually less important than the tidal current or the local wind current. Sea currents

are not always steady, so averages should be used with caution. Sea current estimates may 
be obtained from direct observation at the scene (such as ship set and drift, trajectories of 
drifting objects having zero leeway), output from computer models of ocean circulation, 
and hydrographic tables and charts.
(2) Tidal or rotary currents. In coastal waters, currents change in direction and speed as the 
tides change. They may be estimated from tidal current tables, current charts, and pilot

charts. However, local knowledge often will be of the greatest value.
(3) River current. This should be considered only if the survivors may be in, or near, the mouth 
of a large river (such as the Amazon).
(4) Local wind current (WC). Local wind current is due to the effect of sustained local winds 
on the water’s surface. The exact effect of wind in creating local wind currents is not clear, 
but it is generally assumed that after 6 to 12 hours with the wind in a constant direction, a

local surface current is generated. The estimated average wind velocity and direction for 
the previous 24 to 48 hours should be verified by contacting ships which have been in 
the vicinity of the distress scene. The direction and velocity of local wind current can be 
estimated using the Local Wind Current Graph in figure N-1.
 Vector (direction and speed) values must be obtained for each of these which is present and

added, vector fashion, to obtain the total water current (TWC). Figure 4-6 shows how to compute 
TWC offshore in the open ocean.

Total water current (kts)
Figure 4-6 – Computing total water current from sea current and wind current
 Wind and current observations
4.4.4 The best way to obtain wind and TWC information is through direct observation. One way to get such

observations is from ships passing through the area. Such vessels should be asked to report set and 
drift as well as wind and other weather observations. If they are available, the observed movements 
of drifting buoys designed to have zero leeway and move with the surface currents can be used to 
determine TWC. Datum marker buoys have been mainly designed for use in determining total water

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
4-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
current in the search area and for relocating drifting objects. There are buoys which can also provide 
elements of leeway.  There are two primary sources for obtaining this type of information: 
(a) SRUs, ships and aircraft, can deploy datum marker buoys (DMBs). There are two types of DMBs. 
The radio type DMB is located by radio direction finding from the SRU which must relocate the

DMB for each current estimate (and send the DMB position and time back to the search planner). 
The self-locating DMB (SLDMB) uses GNSS technology to determine the buoy’s position. It 
provides frequent, precise position information via satellite to a database for use by the search 
planner. This means that the SRU does not have to relocate the SLDMB or report its position. 
When using DMBs, search planners should use their best judgement to estimate the area into

which to deploy DMBs. For example, multiple or high currents in the probable search area are 
best handled by deploying several DMBs so as to gain a better picture of the influence of the 
current. Time is also a consideration. An incident in which the last known position is known and 
the time lag to DMB deployment is minimal, only a single DMB may be necessary. However, 
if a large time lag exists, or the last known position is not available, or there is potential for an

extended search, then multiple DMBs should be used.
(b) Many other satellite-tracked buoys are adrift in the world’s oceans in conjunction with various 
oceanographic studies. Unfortunately, there is no centralized database for identifying the 
principal investigator for a study and no mechanism for obtaining near-real-time observations 
for search planning purposes. However, it may be worthwhile to contact nearby universities

or Government agencies engaged in oceanographic studies and determine whether they 
have, or can obtain, more accurate TWC information than that already available to the search 
planner. Caution: Many drifting buoys used in oceanographic studies are drogued to move with 
sub-surface currents. Those that move with the upper one or two metres of the ocean measure 
total water current while those that are designed to move with deeper currents tend to measure

only sea current. Advance planning and an exchange of visits between search planners and 
nearby oceanographers would help in establishing ways to obtain near-real-time sea current 
data suitable for use in search planning.
 Other sources of wind and current data
4.4.5 While direct observations provide the best data for the place and time of the observation, such data 
are not always available when and where they are needed for search planning. The next best source

of data is the output of computer models used for predicting weather and sea conditions. Output 
from such models, especially weather models, is widely distributed around the globe and is often 
used by local weather bureaus, which modify it to account for local observations and effects. Each 
RCC should work closely with weather bureaus in its area of responsibility to ensure this source of 
environmental data is available when needed. Caution:  Output from some sea current prediction

models includes local wind effects based on wind predictions. The search planner should NOT add 
local wind current to such sea current predictions. Finally, pilot charts, hydrographic atlases, tidal 
current tables, etc., may be used to obtain estimates for current. Sea currents taken from pilot charts 
or hydrographic atlases for areas having persistent winds, that is, nearly constant wind speed and

direction almost all the time, should not have wind current added to them. This typically applies to 
areas of the world affected by trade winds, such as the north-east trade winds between southern 
Europe and the Caribbean basin.
 Estimating survivor drift
4.4.6 Once the directions and speeds of the leeway and TWC vectors are estimated, the directions and 
rates of drift are computed by adding the leeway and TWC vectors as shown in figure 4-7 . Normally,

all velocities are computed in nautical miles per hour (knots).
 Establishing a new datum
4.4.7 The estimated distance an object has drifted is computed as the number of hours since the last 
computed datum multiplied by the drift speed, using the familiar formula:
 distance = speed × time.

(a) Single point and leeway divergence datums. Updating a previous point datum to account for 
drift motion and to produce a new point datum is done by moving from the previous datum in 
the direction of the drift vector for a distance equal to the estimated drift distance, as shown in 
figure 4-8. In a drift involving leeway, the first drift interval will produce two new datum points,

one for each of the leeway vectors. Thereafter, it is assumed that the “left” datum will always use 
the leeway vector that is to the left of the downwind direction and the “right” datum will always 
use the leeway vector that is to the right of the downwind direction.

(b) Line and area datums. If the drift forces (wind and current) are nearly the same everywhere in the 
search and surrounding areas, the new line or area datum location is found by moving it in the same 
fashion as point datums are moved using the average of the winds and currents. However, if the drift 
forces at some points on the line or in some sub-areas of the scenario’s possibility area are significantly

different from those in others, it becomes necessary to carefully choose a representative set of points

to treat as datum points. These datum points should be chosen so that all significant variations in 
winds and currents are represented. Estimates for drift direction and distance must then be computed 
separately for each chosen point and a new datum point estimated. Finally, a new datum line or 
area based on the new datum points must be estimated. Figure 4-9 shows a situation where a craft’s

intended track line crossed a strong sea current. Note the difference in the shapes of the intended 
track and the new datum.

 Drift error (De)
4.4.8 The computed drift velocities and the resulting drift distances are uncertain figures.
(a) While the leeway characteristics of many types of craft have been approximately determined

by experiment, those of the remaining craft are only rough estimates. Furthermore, few leeway 
studies have data for high wind speeds. Therefore, estimates for high wind speeds are likely 
to be inaccurate. Often it is not known whether a drogue or sea anchor has been deployed. 
Most craft show a tendency to have leeway off the downwind direction, creating even more 
leeway uncertainty. Techniques for estimating local wind current also produce uncertain results.

Neither wind nor sea current data typically exist on a scale precise enough to make accurate 
computation of an object’s actual drift trajectory possible.
(b) The search planner is faced with computing the trajectory of a small solid object suspended at 
the turbulent interface between two huge fluid masses – the ocean and the atmosphere – with 
only sparse and uncertain data. The search object’s motion cannot be predicted with absolute 
certainty under these conditions.

certainty under these conditions.
(c) The combined effects of the uncertainties in both environmental data and drift characteristics 
of the search object are taken into account by calculating the probable drift error rate (total 
probable drift velocity error) in knots. Multiplying the length of the drift interval in hours by this 
value gives the total probable drift position error ( De). If uncertainty values are unavailable, a

probable error rate of 0.3 knots is usually assumed for each component of the drift velocity. The 
greater the uncertainty about the object’s drift characteristics of the winds and currents driving 
it, the greater the probable drift error rate estimate will be.
4.5  Total probable error of position
4.5.1 Datum estimates are subject to a number of errors. Knowing the total effect of these errors is important

because it determines how much of the surrounding area should be searched with the available search 
effort to maximize the chances of finding the search object. For point datums, the total probable error 
of position (E) defines the circular area having a 50% chance of containing the survivors, taking into 
account the probable error in the incident position ( X, see paragraph 4.3.5), the probable error in

the drift estimate ( De, see paragraph 4.4.8) if drift is a factor, and the probable error in the search 
craft’s position (Y, see paragraph 4.5.2). Sections 4.6 and 4.7 describe how the total probable error of 
position is used to determine the best area to search with the available search facilities.
4.5.2 S earch facility position error (Y). The search facility’s ability to accurately locate the search area has

an impact on the size of the area which needs to be covered in order to avoid missing important 
portions. The probable error in search facility position may be estimated using the guidance provided 
in tables N-1 through N-3 for estimating the size of probable position error for different types of craft 
and navigation equipment. The search planner may use other, more accurate, estimates if they are 
available.

4.5.3 Total probable error of position  (E). The total probable error in an estimated datum position is a 
function of the probable error in the estimated distress incident position ( X), the probable error in 
estimated post-distress survivor movement (De), and the probable position error of the search facility 
(Y). The formula for computing total probable error of position is:

 Sweep width (W)*– A measure of the effectiveness with which a particular sensor can detect a 
particular object under specific environmental conditions. Sweep width values for combinations

of sensor, search object and environmental conditions are computed from the sweep width 
tables provided in appendix N.
 Search effort (Z)* – The area effectively swept by a search facility within its assigned search 
sub-area. Search effort is computed as the product of search speed ( V), search endurance (T), 
and sweep width (W). Z = V × T × W.

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
4-12 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 Effort factor (fZ)* – (1) For single point and leeway divergence datums, the effort factor is the 
square of the total probable error of position (E). fZp = E2. (2) For line datums, the effort factor 
is the product of the total probable error of position ( E) and the length of the datum line ( L). 
fZl = E × L.

fZl = E × L.
 Relative effort (Zr)* – The amount of available search effort (Z) divided by the effort factor. The 
relative effort relates the size of the effort available for a particular search to the size of the search 
object’s location probability distribution for that search. Zr = Z/fZ.
 Cumulative relative effort (Z rc)* – The sum of all previous relative efforts plus the relative 
effort for the next planned search effort. This value determines the optimal search factor.

Zrc = Zr−1 + Zr−2 + Zr−3 + ... + Zr−next search.
 Optimal search factor (f s)* – A value which, when multiplied by the total probable error of 
position (E), produces the optimal search radius. Ro = E × fs. The width of the optimal search 
square (point datums) or rectangle (leeway divergence and line datums) is always twice the 
optimal search radius. Width = 2 × Ro.
 Coverage factor (C)* – The ratio of the search effort ( Z) to the area searched ( A). C = Z/A.

For parallel sweep searches, it may be computed as the ratio of sweep width ( W) to track 
spacing (S). C = W/S.
 Probability of detection (POD)* – The probability of the search object being detected, assuming 
it was in the areas that were searched. POD  is a function of coverage factor, sensor, search 
conditions and the accuracy with which the search facility navigates its assigned search pattern.

Probability of success (POS)* – The probability of finding the search object with a particular 
search. For each sub-area searched, POS = POC × POD. For several simultaneous searches or 
several searches within a specific period of time (for example, on a particular day) for the same 
search object, the total POS is the sum of all the individual search sub-area POS values.
 Cumulative probability of success (POSc)* – The accumulated probability of finding the search

object with all the search effort expended over all searches to date. POS c is the sum of all 
individual search POS values.
 Grid – Any set of intersecting perpendicular lines spaced at regular intervals.
 Grid cell – A square or rectangular area formed by pairs of adjacent, perpendicular grid lines.
 On-scene endurance – The amount of time a facility may spend at the scene engaged in search 
and rescue activities.

and rescue activities.
 Optimal search plan  – A plan that maximizes the probability of success attained using the 
available search effort.
 Search area – The area, determined by the search planner, that is to be searched. This area may 
be subdivided into search sub-areas for the purpose of assigning specific responsibilities to the 
available search facilities.
 Search endurance (T) – The amount of “productive” search time available at the scene. This

figure is usually taken to be 85% of the on-scene endurance, leaving a 15% allowance for 
investigating sightings and navigating turns at the ends of search legs.
 Search speed (V) – The speed (or velocity) with which a search facility moves over the ground 
when searching.
 Search sub-area – A designated area to be searched by a specific assigned search facility or 
possibly two facilities working together in close coordination.

Sensors – Human senses (sight, hearing, touch, etc.), those of specially trained animals (such as 
dogs), or electronic devices used to detect the object of a search.

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 4-13
 Possibility sub-area – Any sub-division of the possibility area. Possibility areas are usually divided 
into sub-areas to develop a probability map or description of the distribution of probable search 
object locations within the range of all possible locations. When used in this way, each possibility 
sub-area is assigned a Probability of Containment ( POC) value based on the likelihood of the

search object being in that sub-area. Possibility sub-areas are usually cells in a grid but use 
of grids is not required. Possibility sub-areas may or may not correspond to designated search 
sub-areas.
 Track spacing (S) – For searches using equally spaced parallel sweeps, track spacing is the 
distance between the centres of adjacent sweeps, or, in other words, the spacing between 
adjacent search facility tracks or search legs.

adjacent search facility tracks or search legs.
4.6.2 Scenario. As discussed in chapter 3, the available information about a SAR incident is often incomplete, 
may contain errors, and may be misleading. To make up for these deficiencies, the search planner 
must create one or more accounts of what probably happened to the survivors from the time they 
were last known to be safe up to the current time. These accounts, part fact and part assumption,

are called scenarios. Scenarios are the basis for planning a search. To be valid, a scenario must be 
consistent with the known facts of the situation. To justify using it as a basis for searching, a scenario 
should have a high probability of being true. If several possible scenarios exist, the search planner 
must decide which are the most likely to be true and pursue them accordingly. As new information

becomes available, search planners should modify, discard or create new scenarios as needed to 
ensure all those under consideration are consistent with all the available data. Creating, re-evaluating, 
modifying, and discarding scenarios requires sound, mature judgement, experience, knowledge, skill, 
and self-discipline. Scenario analysis and development, along with related investigative efforts to

obtain more information, often determine a successful outcome to the distress incident. The search 
planner must think like a detective who is trying to solve an important case or a scientist who is 
trying to answer an important question. Lines of evidence must be followed to see where they lead. 
The available facts must be viewed from different perspectives. Missing information must be filled

in with different, but plausible, assumptions to create plausible scenarios. At times, several scenarios 
can be developed that are consistent with all or most of the known facts. These scenarios must be 
carefully evaluated and weighted according to the search planner’s judgement about which scenarios 
are more likely and which are less likely to represent the actual situation. These efforts can be difficult,

demanding tasks and require dedication by the search planner to attain the best chance for success.
4.6.3 Possibility area. This term is used in two ways. The first usage describes every possible location 
regardless of how likely or unlikely the chances are for finding survivors there. The second usage 
defines a (usually) much smaller area containing all possible locations which are consistent with a 
particular scenario the search planner has developed.

(a)  The first meaning of possibility area is the smallest area that includes every physically possible 
location, however unlikely it may be. For example, the possibility area for a missing aircraft is 
an approximately circular area centred on the aircraft’s last known position and extending in all 
directions as far as its remaining fuel would carry it, accounting for wind effects at all possible 
altitudes the aircraft might have used. Knowing the extent of this area is useful for deciding

which aerodromes and other facilities (police and fire departments, etc.) to query for possible 
additional information about the aircraft. It is also useful for distinguishing incoming reports 
which might be related to the missing aircraft from those that are not. However, this type of 
possibility area is usually not very useful for planning searches because it is normally much too 
large to search effectively with the available search effort. Frequently search planners deal with

this problem by creating scenarios from the known facts and some logical assumptions about 
what most likely happened.
(b)  The second meaning of possibility area is the smallest area that includes every possible location 
which is consistent with a particular scenario. This is called the scenario’s possibility area. 
Usually this area is much smaller than that described in paragraph 4.6.3 (a) and is very useful for

planning searches. In fact, the primary function of scenario development is to focus the search

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
4-14 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
effort so the most likely locations may be searched effectively. For the remainder of this chapter, 
this more restrictive second meaning will be used unless otherwise noted.
4.6.4 Search objects. While the ultimate goal of searching is to locate and assist distressed persons, searchers 
need to be alert for objects or signals which may provide clues about their location. Search objects

include such things as:
 – boats, rafts and other survival craft;
 – debris or other evidence of the distress incident; and
 – signals, such as those discussed in chapter 2, from the survivors or their equipment. Such signals 
may be visual, aural or electronic.
 All search objects have characteristics that determine how well they can be detected by various sensors 
under various environmental conditions. Some search objects, particularly in the marine environment,

also have motion characteristics which determine the possible range of their post-distress movements.
4.6.5 Probability of containment (POC). Once a datum for a search has been established, the search planner 
must decide exactly where and how to search the surrounding area. The possibility area is defined as 
the smallest area which contains all possible survivor locations (POC = 100%) consistent with the facts

and assumptions (scenario) under consideration. Even a single scenario’s possibility area can be too 
large to search effectively with the available search facilities. Often, some sub-areas are more likely 
to contain survivors than others. In this case, the search planner should divide the possibility area into 
sub-areas and estimate the POC for each sub-area. One simple technique is to place a grid over the

possibility area, dividing it into a number of cells. A POC value then needs to be assigned to each cell 
to produce a probability map. These values may be subjective estimates based on the search planner’s 
best judgement, or they may be taken from a standard assumed probability distribution. In either case, 
it is important to ensure that the total of all cell probabilities initially adds up to 100%. As the search

progresses, POCs of areas that have been searched need to be updated as described in paragraph 4.6.11.
4.6.6 Probability map. Figure 4-10 shows the specific numeric probabilities, expressed as percentages, 
associated with each cell of a grid laid over the standard assumed initial distribution around a datum 
point. That distribution is of the circular normal type. The probability of the search object being

contained in the dashed circle whose radius is the total probable error of position ( E) is 50%. The 
remaining area in the corners of the centre cell have a 7 .91% probability of containing the search 
object, making the total POC for the cell 57 .91%.

 Figure 4-11 shows the initial cell probabilities as they might appear for a line datum. The instructions 
and standard probability values needed for preparing initial point and line datum probability maps 
are provided in appendix M. Before any searching is done, the total of all cells should theoretically

equal 100%. In practice, the initial total may vary slightly due to rounding errors for individual cell 
probabilities. Similar probability maps are used later to show how the probability of success for a 
search is computed.

4.6.7 Sweep width (W). Sweeping an area visually or with electronic sensors is analogous to sweeping a 
floor with a broom. Usually the most efficient way to sweep a floor is with a series of parallel strokes 
spaced at equal intervals. For a broom, the sweep width is equal to the width of the broom. The same

principle applies to searching, although the effect of a single sweep is not quite as sharply defined 
as it is for a broom. Sweep width is a measure of the ability to detect a search object. Large objects 
are easier to see on clear days than small objects and therefore have larger visual sweep widths. All 
objects are easier to see when the air is clear than when it is hazy, which makes an object’s visual

sweep width higher on a clear day than on a hazy day. Objects made of metal are usually easier to 
detect by radar than those of a similar size and shape made of fibreglass, which means that metal 
objects usually have larger radar sweep widths than fibreglass ones. For each combination of sensor, 
search object, and set of environmental conditions, a sweep width can be estimated using tables * 
of values (described below) based on many years of experience and testing. Not all search objects

within one-half of the sweep width either side of the search facility will be detected and there will be 
times when search objects are detected at greater distances. In fact, the probability of a search object 
being detected if it is more than one-half sweep width from the search facility’s track is equal to the 
probability it will be missed if it is inside that distance. This property results from the mathematical

definition of sweep width used in search theory. Figure 4-12 illustrates the detection profile (also 
called a lateral range curve) and sweep width for visual search under ideal conditions.†
(a) Computing sweep width. Actual values for sweep widths depend on the sensor, the search object, 
and the on-scene environmental conditions. Tables of uncorrected sweep width values and 
correction factors are provided in appendix N to aid the search planner in estimating sweep width

values for a given set of circumstances. The sweep width used in planning and evaluating the 
search is computed as the product of the uncorrected sweep width and all the correction factors.
* Refer to tables N-4 to N-12 of appendix N.
† This profile is based on the inverse cube law of visual detection first proposed by B.O. Koopman circa 1946 and described again in 
his book, Search and Screening, Pergamon Press, 1980.

(b) Example. If the search facility is a merchant vessel, the primary “sensor” is the eyes of the crew 
(visual search), the search object is a 6-person liferaft, meteorological visibility is 28 km (15 NM), 
and the wind is 30 km/h (16 kts), the sweep width is computed as follows:
 Uncorrected sweep width (Wu) = 11.5 km or 6.2 NM
 Weather correction factor (fw) = 0.9
 W = 11.5 km × 0.9 = 10.4 km, or
 W = 6.2 NM × 0.9 = 5.6 NM

W = 6.2 NM × 0.9 = 5.6 NM
 where the uncorrected sweep  width and weather correction  factor values were taken from 
tables N-4 and N-7 .
4.6.8 Search effort (Z). The number of available search facilities and their capabilities determine the available 
search effort. Factors to be considered include search speeds, search endurances, sensors, weather 
conditions, search altitudes, visibility, terrain, size of the search object, etc. These factors determine

the sweep width and how much distance a search facility can cover in the search area. The search 
speed, endurance and sweep width determine the search effort available from each facility.
(a)  Search effort computation. A search facility’s available search effort is the product of its search 
speed (V), search endurance (T), and sweep width (W):
 Z = V × T × W
 The total available search effort ( Zta) available from several facilities is the sum of the efforts 
available from each facility:

available from each facility:
 Zta = Zf−1 + Zf−2 + Zf−3 + ...

(b) Example. If an aircraft search facility’s assigned search sub-area will be approximately 100 
nautical miles from its base of operations, its transit speed to and from its assigned search 
sub-area is 200 knots, its search speed is 160 knots, and its total endurance is six hours, then 
a total of one hour will be spent in transit, leaving five hours for on-scene activities. To allow

time for investigating sightings and navigating turns at the ends of the search legs, the on-scene 
endurance is reduced by 15% to give the search endurance. The search endurance is then 85% 
of the on-scene endurance which is computed as 0.85 × 5 or 4.25 h. If the sweep width is three 
nautical miles, then the available search effort (Z) for that facility is computed as follows:
 Z = 160 × 4.25 × 3 = 2,040 square nautical miles

Z = 160 × 4.25 × 3 = 2,040 square nautical miles
 Note: The masters of vessels and pilots in command of aircraft are the best sources for estimates 
of available on scene endurance times and search speeds for their craft. These individuals should 
be consulted before a search plan involving them is finalized.

along a line datum with a given amount of search effort, it is necessary to compare the size of the 
available effort with the size of the search object location probability distribution. The basis for such 
a comparison is the effort factor, which is proportional to the area covered by the distribution.
(a)  Point datums. For point datums, the effort factor is the square of the total probable error of 
position (E):
 fZp = E2

position (E):
 fZp = E2
(b)  Line datums. For line datums, the effort factor is the product of the total probable error of 
position (E) and the length of the datum line (L):
 fZl = E × L
(c)  Point datums connected by a line datum. The probability distribution centred on a “pure” datum 
line is assumed to be uniform along the line and normally distributed on either side of the line. 
The probability of the search object being beyond either end of the line is assumed to be zero.

When two point datums are connected by a line datum, this is a reasonable approximation if the 
distance between the datums is large compared to the average of their respective total probable 
errors of position. The procedures described in the example of paragraph 4.7 .5 will produce a 
near-optimal search factor for small to moderate levels of relative effort when L is computed as 
the distance between the datum points.

the distance between the datum points.
 Note: For larger relative efforts (Zr greater than 10) or short distances between datum points (L 
less than 5 × E), one alternative is to increase the value of L so the datum line extends beyond 
the datum points. Another alternative is to evaluate search areas based on both the point datum 
effort factor ( fZp) and the line datum effort factor ( fZl) and choose an optimal search factor

somewhere between the one recommended for a point datum and the one recommended for a 
line datum. The closer the points are to one another, the more the distribution will resemble that 
of a single point datum. No matter how small L becomes, the effort factor should never be less 
than E2. That is, if L is less than E, use fZp, not fZl. The length and width of the search area may 
be adjusted by the search planner as needed to accommodate the shape of the distribution.

4.6.10 Relative effort (Zr). To determine the optimal area to be searched around a point datum or along a 
line datum with a given amount of search effort, it is necessary to compare the size of the available 
effort with the size of the search object location probability distribution to be searched. This is done 
by computing the ratio of the available effort to the effort factor as follows:
 Zr = Zta/fZ

Zr = Zta/fZ
4.6.11 Cumulative relative effort (Zrc). It is also necessary to account for all previous effort when determining 
the next optimal area to search with the present or projected available effort. This is done by computing 
the sum of all previous relative efforts and the one computed for the next search. Thus:
 Zrc = Zr−1 + Zr−2 + Zr−3 + ... + Zr−next search

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
4-18 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 The cumulative relative effort is used with the optimal search factor graphs in appendix N to determine 
the optimal search factor to use in planning the next search. Cumulative relative effort is used rather 
than cumulative effort to ensure that any changes in the total probable error of position from one

search to the next are automatically taken into account when computing the optimal search factor. 
Examples are given in section 4.7 .
 Note: Relative effort and cumulative relative effort are used only for planning optimal searches for 
single point, leeway divergence and line datums. For area datums, another technique, described in 
paragraph 4.7 .6, is used.
4.6.12 Optimal search factor (fs). The optimal search factor is used together with the total probable error of

position (E) to compute the optimum size of the next search area. The optimal search radius is:
 Ro = fs × E
 As discussed further in section 4.7 , the width of the optimal search square (for point datums) or 
rectangle (for leeway divergence and line datums) is always twice the optimal search radius.
4.6.13 Coverage factor (C). The coverage factor compares the amount of searching done in an area to the

size of that area. For accurately navigated search patterns that fill the area, it is a measure of how well 
the area was covered.
(a) Universal definition. The coverage factor is the ratio of the search effort (Z) expended in a search 
sub-area to the size of that area (A):
 C = Z/A
(b) Example 1. If the available search effort is 1,000 square nautical miles and the area to be searched 
is 2,000 square nautical miles, then searching the entire area would result in a coverage factor of

1,000/2,000 or 0.5. Searching only half the area would result in a coverage factor of 1,000/1,000 
or 1.0 for the half that was searched and zero for the other half.
(c) Parallel Sweep Definition. For parallel sweep search patterns, an equivalent way to compute 
coverage factor is to take the ratio of sweep width (W) to track spacing (S):
 C = W/S
(d) Example 2. If a search sub-area is completely covered with a parallel sweep search pattern

having a track spacing of 5 nautical miles and the sweep width for the search object is 3 nautical 
miles, then the coverage factor is   3 _ 5   or 0.6.
4.6.14 Probability of detection (POD). The probability of detection is a measure of how well an area has 
been searched. Therefore, POD is closely related to coverage factor. In fact, POD is a function of the 
amount of searching done in an area, the sensor’s detection profile, and the method of moving the

sensor through the area. Search patterns with equally spaced parallel sweeps tend to maximize POD if 
they are perfectly navigated. As conditions deteriorate, due to weather, search facility navigation error 
or both, the POD is adversely affected. Not only can the effective sweep width decrease as conditions 
deteriorate, the detection profile can change in a way that reduces the detection advantage obtained

by using parallel sweeps. Figure 4-13 shows typical visual detection profiles for both ideal and normal 
search conditions. The POD graph in figure N-10 shows the corresponding curves for average POD  
in an area covered by equally spaced parallel sweeps as a function of the coverage factor *. When 
search conditions are ideal, the upper POD curve may be used. In normal conditions, the lower POD 
curve should be used. Intermediate values may be used if conditions are between ideal and normal.

It should be noted that “normal conditions” include any situation significantly less than ideal. Anytime 
the corrected sweep width for a search object is less than the maximum uncorrected sweep width for
* The “ideal”’ POD curve in figure N-10 is based on Koopman’s inverse cube law of visual detection while the “normal” curve is based 
on the so-called random search curve, also covered in Search and Screening (see note on page 4-15).

 that object, conditions are less than ideal. By the time the corrected sweep width for a search object 
is down to one half the maximum possible value for that object, the lower curve should be in use.

(a) Example 1. The sweep width for a downed aircraft (less than 5700 kg) from an altitude of 300 m in 
hilly terrain with a visibility of 6 km is about 2.3 km. The maximum uncorrected sweep width for 
the same object from the same altitude is 5.6 km when the visibility is 37 km or greater. Since 2.3 
is less than half of 5.6, search conditions are normal and the lower POD curve should be used.
(b)  Example 2. Search conditions are also considered normal when the probable search facility

navigation error is as large as, or larger than, the sweep width. This means search facility 
navigation error need not be large in absolute terms to make use of the lower POD curve 
appropriate. Search objects are often small with correspondingly small sweep widths. By the 
time the probable search facility navigation error is as large as the sweep width, the lower curve 
should be in use. If the sweep width is two miles, then a probable search facility navigation error

of only two miles would be needed to drop POD estimates to the lower curve.
 Note: POD is not  a measure of the search effort’s chances for success (probability of success 
or POS), although there is a relationship between POD, POS, and the probability of the search 
object being contained in the area searched (POC). POD is only a conditional probability which 
measures the chances of finding the search object if it happens to be in the area searched. POS

and the relationship among POD, POC, and POS are discussed in paragraph 4.6.15.
4.6.15 Probability of success (POS). The probability of success is the probability of finding the search object. 
POS is the true measure of search effectiveness . Finding the search object depends on two things: 
having sensors capable of detecting it, and placing those sensors close enough to the search object 
to make detection likely. POD measures the chances of detecting the search object if  it is actually

in the area searched. POC measures the likelihood of the search object actually being in the area 
searched. A thorough search of an area ( POD ≈ 100%) which has almost no chance of containing 
the search object (POC ≈ 0%) has almost no chance of succeeding ( POS ≈ 0%). Likewise, a very 
normal search of an area (POD ≈ 0%) that almost certainly contains the search object (POC ≈ 100%) 
also has almost no chance of succeeding (POS ≈ 0%). If either POD or POC is zero, so is the POS

for that particular effort. In other words, if the search object is not in the search area, no amount

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
4-20 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
of search effort can find it; and failing to search the area which does contain the search object will 
never produce a successful result. Only if both POD and POC equal 100% is success guaranteed. 
The actual POS usually lies between these extremes. All intermediate POS values are possible from 
different combinations of values for POC and POD.

different combinations of values for POC and POD.
(a)  The equation describing the relationship of POS to POC and POD is:
 POS = POC × POD
(b)  Example. If the POC for a search sub-area is 65% (0.65) and the search effort expended in that 
sub-area produces a coverage factor of 1.0, the POD under ideal conditions is estimated to be 
79% (0.79). The POS for that sub-area is then computed as:
 POS = 0.65 × 0.79 = 0.51 or 51%
 For normal search conditions, the POS would be:

For normal search conditions, the POS would be:
 POS = 0.65 × 0.63 = 0.41 or 41%
4.6.16 Updating POCs to account for previous searching. Even when it is unsuccessful, searching a sub-area 
provides information about the survivors’ probable location; it provides new evidence which now 
makes it less likely they were in the searched area. In the example of paragraph 4.6.15 above, the 
initial POC for the sub-area searched was 65%. Searching that area without finding the survivors

means the search planner should revise the estimate of their likelihood of being in that area downward 
by an appropriate amount. This is done using the following equation:
 POCnew = (1 - POD) × POCold
 For areas not searched, POC does not change. That is, POCnew = POCold.
(a)  Example 1. Using the POC and POD values from 4.6.15, the new POC for ideal search conditions 
is computed as:
 POCnew = (1.0 - 0.79) × 0.65 = 0.21 × 0.65 = 0.14 or 14%

(b)  Example 2. For normal search conditions, the new POC is computed as:
 POCnew = (1.0 - 0.63) × 0.65 = 0.37 × 0.65 = 0.24 or 24%
(c)  Example 3. Another way of looking at this process is to note the POS of the search done under 
ideal conditions, which was 51%. That is, searching extracted 51% of the probability from the 
distribution and all of it came from the one sub-area that was searched, which only had 65% of

the probability to begin with. Hence, 65% - 51% = 14%, which is the same result as before. 
Similarly, for the search done under normal conditions, 65% - 41% = 24%.
4.6.17 C umulative probability of success (POSc). Cumulative POS measures the effectiveness of all searching 
done to date. It is the sum of all the POS values for each search. For example, if the POS for the first 
search was 40% and that for the second search was 35%, then the total POS  for the two searches

would be 75%. This in turn means the remaining probability of the search object being in the possibility 
area is now only 25%. In fact the cumulative POS after completion of the nth search is:
 POSc = POS1 + POS2 + POS3 + ... + POSn
 and also:
 POSc = 1 - (The total of all POCnew cell values in the possibility area after the nth search)
 Searching may be thought of as a means for subtracting probability from a scenario’s possibility

area and putting it into POS and POSc. As POSc rises toward 100%, the total POC in the scenario’s 
possibility area decreases toward 0%. A high POS c value is an indicator that further efforts in that 
scenario’s possibility area are likely to be futile. Things to consider when POSc reaches a high value 
are discussed in paragraph 4.7 .9. For optimal square searches around a point datum, cumulative POS

may be obtained directly from figure N-11 by entering the point datum POS graph with the cumulative 
relative effort. For optimal rectangular searches along a line datum, cumulative POS may be obtained 
from figure N-12 by entering the line datum POS graph with the cumulative relative effort.
4.7 Optimal search effort allocation
4.7.1 The search planner’s problem, in simple terms, is one of determining how to make the most effective

use of the available search facilities. Survivors need to be located quickly if lives are to be saved. 
Searching is expensive and sometimes puts the search facilities at increased risk. Both of these facts 
make achieving the maximum search effectiveness an important consideration. In the following 
paragraphs, a strategy for the deployment of search facilities is described which maximizes search 
effectiveness. This is accomplished by:

effectiveness. This is accomplished by:
 – dividing the scenario’s possibility area into sub-areas;
 – estimating a POC for each sub-area;
 – developing a search plan that maximizes POS;
 – conducting the search plan;
 – updating all POC values to reflect the search results; and
 – using the updated POC values to maximize POS for the next search.
 This strategy is also self-correcting. Even if the choice of initial POCs does not place the search object

in a sub-area having a high POC value, following this strategy will tend to move the focus of the search 
toward the survivors’ actual location.
4.7. 2 Effort allocation. Most of the time, the search planner does not have enough search facilities to attain a 
high coverage factor over all possible survivor locations or even all those associated with a particular 
scenario. The problem then becomes one of deciding where to place the search effort and how much

to concentrate it to maximize the chances for success. The search planner must decide whether to 
search a small area with a high coverage factor or a larger area with a lower coverage factor. The best 
choice is usually the one which maximizes POS. Maximizing POS depends on:
 – how much search effort is available; and
 – how the search object location probabilities are distributed.
 Paragraphs 4.7 .3 through 4.7 .6 provide guidance on how to optimally allocate effort for three standard

types of search object location probability distributions and a generalized distribution.
4.7. 3 Uniform distributions. According to search theory, the best way to search evenly distributed search 
object location probabilities is to spread the available effort uniformly over the scenario’s entire 
possibility area. This will always produce the maximum POS, even though POD values may be low. In

practice, however, coverage factors of less than 0.5 are not recommended. Initial probability maps for 
uniform distributions are usually made by laying a regular grid of equally sized cells over the possibility 
area and placing an equal amount of probability in each cell. The amount of probability in each cell 
would be equal to 1.0 (or 100%) divided by the number of cells. In a 10 × 10 grid (100 cells), each 
cell would be assigned a POC of 1%.

4.7.4 Distributions concentrated around a datum point. When a single position is used as the datum for 
planning a search, the distribution of search object location probabilities is assumed to be circular 
normal. When graphed in three dimensions (X, Y, and Probability Density), it looks like the graph in 
figure 4-1(a). Corresponding probability maps, using grids with different cell sizes but covering the 
same relative area, are provided in appendix M.

 Once the optimal search area has been found, the search planner can determine the optimal 
coverage factor ( C), the corresponding probability of detection ( POD), and the expected

cumulative probability of success (POSc) as shown in examples that follow. The search planner 
can then proceed to divide the search area into search sub-areas and select search patterns as 
needed for assignment to specific search facilities, as discussed in chapter 5.
(b)  Examples.
(1)  First search. Suppose search conditions are ideal, the computed total probable error of 
position (E1) is 15 NM and the effort available ( Z1) is 1,850 NM2. Computing the relative

effort (Zr-1) for the first search:
   Z r-1 = Z1/E1
2 = 1,850/225 = 8.2
 Because this is the first search:
   Z rc = Zr-1 = 8.2
 From the graphs for point datum optimal search factors in figure N-5, the optimal search 
factor (fs-1) is 1.3. Using this optimal search factor, the optimal radius (Ro1) for this search is:
   R o1 = fs-1 × E1 = 1.3 × 15 = 19.5 NM
 The optimal first search area (A1) is then computed as:
   A 1 = 4 × Ro1
2 = 4 × 19.52 = 4 × 380.25 = 1,521 NM2

2 = 4 × 19.52 = 4 × 380.25 = 1,521 NM2
 The optimal coverage factor (C1) for this search is computed by:
   C 1 = Z1/A1 = 1,850/1,521 = 1.2
 From the POD graph, figure N-10, the POD for this search is about 87%. From the point 
datum POS graph, figure N-11, the cumulative POS (POSc) will be about 68% following the 
search.
(2)  Second search. Suppose the first search was performed using the optimal area and coverage

computed in example (1). Assume conditions for the second search are ideal, the effort 
available for the second search (Z2) is 3,267 NM2, and the total probable error of position 
(E2) is now 18NM. The relative effort for this search (Zr-2) is:
   Z r-2 = Z2/E2
2 = 3,267/324 = 10.1
 The cumulative relative effort (Zrc) is computed as:
   Z rc = Zr-1 + Zr-2 = 8.2 + 10.1 = 18.3
 From the graphs for point datum optimal search factors in figure N-6, the optimal search

factor (fs-2) is 1.7 . The optimal radius for the second search (Ro2) is:
   R o2 = fs-2 × E2 = 1.7 × 18 = 30.6 NM
 The optimal search area for the second search (A2) is then computed as:

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 4-23
   A 2 = 4 × Ro2
2 = 4 × 30.62 = 4  936.4= 3,745 NM2
 The optimal coverage factor (C2) for this search is computed by:
   C 2 = Z2/A2 = 3,267/3,745 = 0.9
 From the POD graph, figure N-10, the POD for this search is about 74%. From the point datum POS 
graph, figure N-11, the cumulative probability of success (POSc) following the second search is about 
87%.

87%.
(c)  Probability maps. Initial probability maps for datum points are provided in appendix M. The POC 
values contained in each grid are based on the same circular normal probability distribution. 
Each grid covers the same amount of the distribution – only the cell size and the number of 
cells changes. The number of cells ranges from 9 (3 × 3) to 144 (12 × 12). These grids may be 
used to update POC values and also compute POS and POSc. Probability maps are very useful

when searching for stationary search objects even when the map probabilities must be updated 
by hand. Their use is always highly recommended for this type of search. However, when 
searching for moving objects, such as a boat or raft adrift on the ocean, maintaining probability 
maps by hand can prove to be very difficult. Updating of probability maps to account for both 
unsuccessful prior searching and increasingly uncertain search object drift is such a complex

task that it is better left to computers programmed for the purpose.
4.7. 5 Distributions concentrated along a datum line. When a line is used as the datum for planning a search, 
the distribution of search object location probabilities is assumed to be uniform along the line and 
normal on either side. When graphed in three dimensions (X, Y, and Probability Density), it looks like 
the graph in figure 4-2 (a). Instructions for creating probability maps for line datums, using grids with

different cell sizes, are provided in appendix M.
(a)  The optimal search area for a line datum is found using the same general procedure as that 
just described for point datums. However, the effort factor is computed slightly differently (see 
paragraph 4.6.9 and the examples below), a separate set of graphs, provided in appendix N, are 
used for finding the optimal search factor and cumulative POS, and the recommended search 
area is a rectangle and not a square.
(b) Examples.

(b) Examples.
(1) First search. Suppose search conditions are normal, the computed total probable error of 
position (E1) is 10 NM, the length (L) of the datum line is 100 NM, and the effort available 
(Z1) is 2,100 NM2. Computing the relative effort (Zr-1) for the first search:
   Z r-1 = Z1/E1
2 = 2,100/1,000 = 2.1
 Because this is the first search:
   Z rc = Zr-1 = 2.1
 From the graphs for line datum optimal search factors, figure N-7 , the optimal search factor

(fs) is 1.05. Using this optimal search factor, the optimal radius (Ro1) for this search is:
   R o1 = fs-1 × E1 = 1.05 × 10 = 10.5 NM
 The optimal first search area (A1) is then computed as:
   A 1 = 2 × Ro1 × L = 2 × 10.5 × 100 = 2,100 NM2
 which is a 21 NM by 100 NM rectangle with its major axis centred on the datum line. The 
optimal coverage factor (C1) for this search is computed by:
   C 1 = Z1/A1 = 2,100/2100 = 1.0

C 1 = Z1/A1 = 2,100/2100 = 1.0
 From the POD graph, figure N-10, the POD for this search is about 63%. From the line 
datum POS graph, figure N-12, the cumulative POS (POSc) will be about 50% following the 
search.

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
4-24 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(2) Second search. Suppose the first search was conducted using the optimal area and coverage 
computed in Example (1). Assume conditions for the second search are normal, the effort 
available for the second search (Z2) is 4,000 NM2, the total probable error of position (E2) is 
unchanged at 10 NM, and the length (L) remains 100 NM. The relative effort for this search 
(Zr-2) is:
   Z r-2 = Z2/E2

(Zr-2) is:
   Z r-2 = Z2/E2
2 = 4,000/1,000 = 4.0
 The cumulative relative effort (Zrc) is computed as:
   Z rc = Zr-1 + Zr-2 = 2.1 + 4.0 = 6.1
 From the graphs for line datum optimal search factors in figure N-8, the optimal search factor 
(fs-2) is 1.5. The optimal radius for the second search (Ro2) is:
   R o2 = fs-2 × E2 = 1.5 × 10 = 15 NM
 The optimal search area for the second search (A2) is then computed as:
   A 2 = 2 × Ro2 × L = 2 × 15 × 100 = 3,000 NM2

A 2 = 2 × Ro2 × L = 2 × 15 × 100 = 3,000 NM2
 which is a 30 NM by 100 NM rectangle with its major axis centred on the datum line. The 
optimal coverage factor (C2) for this search is computed by:
   C 2 = Z2/A2 = 4,000/3,000 = 1.33
 From the POD graph, figure N-10, the POD  for this search is about 74%. From the line 
datum POS graph, figure N-12, the cumulative probability of success (POSc) following the 
second search is about 80%.

second search is about 80%.
(c) Probability maps.  Initial probability cross-section values for datum lines are provided in 
appendix M and instructions for using them to create initial probability maps for line datums 
are contained in appendix M. The POC values contained in each strip are based on the same 
standard normal probability distribution. Each strip covers the same amount of the distribution –

only the cell size and the number of cells change. The number of cells ranges from 3 to 12. 
Probability maps made by means of these strips may be used to update POC  values and also 
compute POS and POSc.
4.7.6 Generalized distributions. The technique described below may be applied to any probability map. 
However, it is usually applied to probability maps where the search object location probability

distribution is not centred on a point or line or differs from one of the standard distributions in 
some other respect. Sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) below provide a general description of a multiple-trial 
method for determining the best way to use the available search effort. The remaining sub-paragraphs 
explain the necessary preparations in more detail and provide examples of this technique’s use in a 
sample search planning problem.

sample search planning problem.
(a) Multiple-trial method. The only way to determine the optimal allocation of search effort for 
non-standard distributions is to perform multiple trials where the available effort is applied to 
different amounts of area on the probability map. The length, width and position of each trial 
area should be adjusted so it contains as much probability as possible. The POS for each trial

area is computed and the one which has the highest POS  is the one that should be searched. 
Three trials are recommended in which searches with coverage factors of 1.0, 0.5, and 1.5 
are tested to see which produces the highest POS . To compute the area ( A) which can be 
searched with a given amount of search effort ( Z) at the different coverages ( C), the equation 
from section 4.6 relating these three quantities:
 C = Z/A

C = Z/A
 is solved for A. The resulting formula for A as a function of effort and coverage factor is:
 A = Z/C

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 4-25
(b) Performing the trials. In the first trial, the amount of area that can be searched exactly equals 
the available search effort. To perform the first test, a probability map is prepared and one 
or more rectangles are formed which have a total area equal to the available search effort. 
Multiple rectangles may be needed in situations where multiple high-probability cells exist but

are separated by enough distance that it is not convenient (maybe not even possible) to include 
them in a single rectangle while maintaining a reasonable coverage factor. The length(s) and 
width(s) of the rectangle(s) are chosen so that when they are plotted on the probability map, 
the maximum amount of probability is contained in the proposed search area(s). The POS for 
the coverage 1.0 search is then computed. A similar test is performed for each of the other trial

coverage factors. In the second trial, the search area is twice the available effort and in the 
third trial the search area is   2 _ 3   of the available search effort. The trial which produces the highest 
POS is then used to plan the search. If time and computing facilities allow, further trials may be 
computed in an attempt to generate a higher POS value. In general, it is usually best to search

the areas with the highest probability densities first and leave the lower density areas for later. 
If the cells of the probability map are of equal size, the POC values may be used directly. If 
they are of different sizes, then dividing the POCs by the areas of their respective cells may be 
necessary to determine where probability densities are the highest.
(c) Detailed preparation. After determining the possibility area for a scenario, the search planner

must divide it into grid cells and assign a POC to each cell to create the initial probability map. 
The sum of all POCs on the initial probability map should equal 100%. Next, the search planner 
needs to estimate the available search effort and compute the amount of area which can be 
covered in each trial. If the probability map consists of cells of equal size, the search planner 
may find it convenient to note how many cells can be covered for each of the three coverage

factors. For example, if the probability map consists of cells measuring 10 NM on a side, so 
each cell covers 100 NM2, and the available search effort is 1,600 NM2, then 16 cells may be 
covered with a coverage factor of 1.0, 32 cells may be covered with a coverage factor of 0.5, 
and 10.667 cells may be covered with a coverage factor of 1.5. For convenience, the search 
planner may wish to adjust the trial area and coverage so a whole number of cells forming a

rectangle is used for the trial. In the last example above, it would probably be easier to test the 
top 10 cells at a coverage of 1.6, the top 11 cells at a coverage of 1.4, or the top 12 cells at a 
coverage of 1.3, especially if their locations on the probability map naturally form a rectangle. 
(The only rectangle 11 cells will form is one that is one cell wide and eleven cells long. This 
may be appropriate for a datum line but in other situations, odd numbers of cells are usually

inconvenient for search planning purposes.) Sometimes, it may be helpful to form a convenient 
rectangle by including a few low-probability cells adjacent to the high-probability cells. These 
types of adjustments will still produce valid results while often eliminating the need to deal with 
fractions of cells or non-rectangular shapes.
(d) Sample search planning problem. The pilot of a small executive jet reported its position at 1300Z.

Next reporting position was 50 NM further along the intended track. The pilot expected to reach 
that point at 1315Z. The next point after that was the destination airport, a further 50 NM along 
the course. No further transmissions were received from the aircraft; visual flight conditions 
covered the entire area. At 1345Z the responsible ATS unit reported the foregoing facts to the 
RCC and stated that the plane had not landed at the destination (which was the closest airport

to the 1300Z position) nor was it in radar contact. From this information, the search planner 
computed the aircraft’s ground speed as 200 knots (50 NM in 15 min = 200 knots). A forced 
landing or crash is assumed and the search planning process is begun. The probable error of 
the aircraft’s reported position is estimated to be 10 NM. Based on this and other information, 
the search planner developed a scenario, determined a corresponding possibility area, divided

it into rectangular cells, and assigned POC values as shown in figure 4-15. Within each cell, the 
distribution of search object location probabilities is assumed to be uniform. Search conditions 
are ideal and a sweep width of 2.0 nautical miles is computed.

(e) First search. In the examples that follow, the multiple-trial technique for determining the optimal 
search area is demonstrated for three different levels of available search effort.

(1) Example 1. Assume the available search facility has a search endurance of four hours at a 
search speed of 150 knots. The available search effort is computed to be 150 × 4 × 2 or 
1,200 square miles. The available effort (1,200 NM2) is just enough to cover the 50% cell 
(1,200 NM2) with a coverage factor of 1.0 as shown in figure 4-16 (a). Multiplying POC  
by POD (0.5 × 0.79), a POS of 39.5% is computed. If the area searched is doubled (to

2,400 NM2) as shown in figure 4-16 (b), a POC of 65% can be attained but the coverage 
factor drops to 0.5. Again multiplying POC by POD (0.65 × 0.47), a POS of 31% is obtained. 
Decreasing the area searched to two-thirds of the original (or 800NM2) as in figure 4-16 (c), 
the POC is estimated to be two-thirds of 50% or 33%. For this trial the coverage factor is 
1.5 and the corresponding POD is 0.94. The POS for this trial is 0.33 × 0.94 or 31%. In this

example, the first alternative produces the highest POS and is the one on which the search 
plan should be based.

(2) Example 2. For this example, assume that only 600 square miles of search effort are 
available. Again starting with a trial coverage factor of 1.0, only half of the 50% cell can 
be covered. This produces a POS of 0.25 × 0.79 or 19.75%. Doubling the area covered 
so the entire 50% cell is covered at a coverage factor of 0.5, the POS  is 0.50 × 0.47 or

23.5%. Reducing the area covered to two-thirds of that used in the first trial produces a 
POC of   2 _ 3   × 0.25 or 17% and a POS of 0.17 × 0.94 or 16%. The second trial produces the 
highest POS this time and is the one which should be used to plan the search. Figure 4-17

(3)  Example 3. For this example, assume that 1,800 square miles of search effort are available. 
This is enough to cover the 50% cell and one-quarter of each 15% cell at coverage 1.0. 
The total POC is then 57 .5% and the POS is 0.575 × 0.79 or 45.43%. Doubling the area 
searched would allow coverage of the 50% cell and both of the 15% cells for a total POC

of 80%. However, the coverage factor would only be 0.5 and the resulting POS would be 
0.8 × 0.47 or 37 .6%. Reducing the search area to two-thirds of that used in the first trial 
allows coverage of just the 50% cell but with a coverage factor of 1.5. The resulting POS is 
0.5 × 0.94 or 47%. The third trial produces the highest POS and should be the one used 
to plan the search. Figure 4-18 illustrates these three trials.

(f) Analysis of the trials. In these three examples, the recommended search sub-area was always 
the same – namely the cell with 50% POC. Only the recommended coverage changed, based 
on the amount of available search effort. This was due mainly to the choice of POC values for 
the cells. The fact that one half of the probability is contained in only one-sixth of the scenario’s

possibility area gives that cell a much higher probability density than any other cell. This makes it 
the best place to put the entire search effort most, but not all, of the time. If the available search 
effort is increased to 2,400 square miles, then covering all of the 50% cell and half of each 
15% cell at coverage 1.0 will produce a POS of 51%. The next trial will produce a POS value 
of 42% for twice the area at coverage 0.5 and the last trial will produce a POS value of 52% for

two-thirds the area at a coverage of 1.5. This last trial would cover the 50% cell plus one-sixth 
of each 15% cell. However, putting all the search effort into the 50% cell at a coverage of 2.0 
produces only a 49% POS . Even in a distribution with a high concentration of probability in 
one cell, it eventually becomes optimal to increase the area searched rather than just increase 
the coverage of the cell with the highest probability density. If the distribution of probabilities

among the cells had been more nearly uniform, increasing the area searched rather than the 
coverage factor would have become optimal sooner. This principle is illustrated in the examples 
of paragraph 4.7 .6.
(g)  Updating the probability map . After each search, the POC  values in each grid cell that was 
searched need to be updated according to the formula given in paragraph 4.6.11. The examples

below continue with the missing aircraft scenario used in example 1 of paragraph 4.7 .6 (e) above. 
In that example, the 50% cell was to be searched with a coverage of 1.0. The examples below 
assume this search has been completed. The new POC for the cell searched is now (1 – 0.79) × 0.5 
or 11%. The updated POCs are shown in figure 4-19.

(h)  Second search. Conditions for the second search are assumed to be ideal. In the examples 
below, the multiple-trial technique is again used to find the best search area.
(1) Example 1. If the available search effort is again 1,200 square miles, then the highest POS 
(14.1%) will be attained by searching the two 15% cells with a coverage factor of 0.5. This 
result was found by using the multiple-trial technique for coverage factors of 1.0, 0.5, and

1.5 as described above in the examples for the first search.

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 4-31
(2) Example 2. Suppose the available search effort is increased to 2,400 square miles for the 
second search. Now, both 15% cells can be searched, as shown in figure 4-20 (a), with 
a coverage of 1.0, producing a POS  of 23.70%. At a coverage of 0.5, the four highest 
cells can be searched, as shown in figure 4-20 (b). The total POC  for these cells is 51%,

giving a POS of 0.51 × 0.47 or 23.97%. Increasing the coverage to 1.5 allows covering 
only two-thirds of each 15% cell, as shown in figure 4-20 (c). This produces a POS  of 
only 18.80%. In looking at these numbers, it seems likely that the optimal coverage lies 
somewhere between 0.5 and 1.0 and probably closer to 0.5. The available effort will allow 
searching the three highest cells with a coverage of 0.67 , as shown in Figure 4-20 (d).

 The resulting POS is 0.41  0.6 or 24.6%. In this instance, the additional trial has shown that 
searching the three cells having the highest POCs with a coverage factor of 0.67 is a more 
nearly optimal allocation of the available search effort than any of the previous trials. The 
new POCs resulting from this search are shown in figure 4-21. The probability map is now

4.7.7 Other Factors. The preceding paragraphs describe how to optimally allocate search effort based on 
theoretical considerations. There are also many practical, and sometimes conflicting, considerations 
which may influence the final search plan. Some things the search planner should evaluate are:

(a) Anticipated increases in survivor location uncertainty. If the survivors are, or may be, moving, 
the uncertainty in their location will increase with every passing hour. In some instances, 
however, the increase will be sudden and large. For example, the possible distress incident 
locations may be limited to a canyon or valley (on land) or a bay, estuary, or strait (at sea). If the 
survivors are in motion and not located quickly, the distribution of possible locations may spread

beyond the limited area, becoming quite large and dispersed. This will greatly complicate the 
search planning problem. Therefore, the search planner may wish to deploy the available search 
facilities in a way that prevents probability from “escaping” the initial, more confined, area and 
becoming dispersed over a much larger and less well-defined area. Such a strategy may well 
reduce the POS on earlier searches in exchange for increasing it on later searches and keeping

the search planning problem manageable.
(b) Forecast search conditions . Weather forecasts are always an important consideration when 
planning searches. If search conditions are very poor, it may be wise to wait and apply the 
search effort after conditions have improved. Similarly, if search conditions are now good or 
excellent, but poor conditions are predicted for later searches, the search planner should seek to

obtain and deploy as much search effort as possible before conditions deteriorate.
(c) Survival times. The chances for continued survival following a distress incident usually decrease 
rapidly with the passage of time, especially for injured persons, persons in the water, or persons 
exposed to temperature extremes. This fact, together with the theoretical considerations 
discussed earlier in this chapter, means a substantial first search effort should be given very

serious consideration despite the logistical and coordination problems associated with mounting 
a large search effort on short notice.
(d) Search object motion during the search . Search objects, especially maritime ones, are often 
in motion while search facilities are looking for them. Despite their slow speed as compared 
with the search facilities’, this motion can be an important factor. If the effects of search object

motion are ignored, they can, in some situations, destroy search effectiveness. To prevent this 
from happening, search legs should always be oriented in the same direction in which the 
search object is expected to move during the search. The search area should be extended in the 
direction of search object motion far enough to ensure that search objects in the original search 
area at the beginning of the search will still be in the extended area at the end of the search. This

is discussed further in chapter 5.

Chapter 4 – Search planning and evaluation concepts
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 4-33
(e) Late clues. Sometimes, the assumptions upon which previous search plans were based are shown 
to be incorrect in some way by the arrival of new information not available earlier. If the most 
probable scenario based upon the new information is significantly different from the previous one, 
it may be necessary to re-compute all previous results, accounting for the impact of the new

information. It may even be necessary, in extreme cases, to discard all previous results and start 
over.
(f) Practical considerations. There are, of course, many other practical considerations used 
in deciding exactly which sub-areas to search and what coverages to use. Maintaining safe 
separations among the search facilities, search facility sensor and navigational capabilities, 
and choices of search patterns are just some of the things which affect the final search plan.

Search planners should modify the recommended search sub-areas and coverages as needed to 
account for all the practical considerations. POS values tend to be very stable near the point of 
perfectly optimal effort allocation. This allows the search planner the freedom needed to adapt 
the theoretically optimal allocation of effort to the realities imposed by the environment and the 
capabilities of the search facilities. Normally, the small changes from optimal values required

for the purpose of developing a practical search plan will not have a large impact on search 
effectiveness (POS). Therefore, the search planner may make such changes with confidence. 
However, after each search cycle (for example, at the end of each search day), search planners 
should also be sure to re-compute all relative effort and cumulative relative effort values based 
on actual effort expended in the search sub-areas. They should also re-compute all coverage

factors, POD, POCnew , POS and POSc values based on the actual sub-areas searched and actual 
effort expended in them. This information will be needed to plan subsequent searches.
4.7.8 Updating distributions to account for search object motion. The examples in sections 4.6 and 4.7 
assumed the effects of search object motion, if any, on the probability distribution were not significant. 
In fact, the only indication of search object motion was the change in total probable error of position

from the first search to the second in paragraph 4.7 .4 (b). (The situation there would correspond to 
sub-paragraph (a) below.) For moving search objects, adjusting the grid cells to reflect the search 
object’s motion between searches and the increasing uncertainty in its location is a necessary, but 
sometimes difficult, task if probability maps are to be used effectively in this situation. The generation

and maintenance of probability maps for searches involving moving objects is best left to computers 
programmed for the purpose. To manually update a probability map for a drifting object, the first step 
is to ensure all the POC values for the existing grid have been updated. In the marine environment the 
next step depends on the environmental situation as it affects drift.
(a) Similar drift forces everywhere. If the drift forces are about the same everywhere in the vicinity

of the scenario’s possibility area, then creating a new probability map simply involves moving 
the existing grid to the new location and expanding it to account for any increase in the total 
probable error of position. The POC  values within grid cells would not change. Figure 4-22 
illustrates this principle, although the distance between datums and the increase in area has 
been exaggerated for clarity.

been exaggerated for clarity.
(b) Significant differences in drift forces. If the drift forces in one part of the scenario’s possibility and 
surrounding area are significantly different from those elsewhere, simply moving and expanding 
will not be sufficient. The grid will also have to be distorted to fit the shape of the new possibility 
area. One way to do this would be to use the corner points, or centre points, or both, of the

grid cells as datum points when updating the datum for drift. If the drift forces in a sub-area are 
sufficiently similar, cells could be grouped and moved together, reducing the number of drift 
computations required. Again, POC values would not change but would simply move with their 
respective cells. If the distortion is too great, the search planner may wish to consider developing 
a new regular grid, laying it over the distorted one and estimating new POC  values from the

distorted probability map. Figure 4-23 illustrates a distorted probability map.

4.7.9 Using POSc. The value of POS c provides one indicator of when further searching in the current 
scenario’s possibility area will no longer produce a reasonable likelihood of locating the survivors. A 
POSc value of 99% means that no matter how much effort is put into the scenario’s possibility area on 
the next search, the POS for that search can be no better than 1%. A high POSc value can mean one 
of the following things about the scenario being used as a basis for planning the search:

(a) The search object never existed or has ceased to exist and cannot be found. For example, persons 
and liferafts that go down with the ship cannot be located by searching the ocean’s surface.
(b) The search object exists but is not in the scenario’s possibility area. In this case, the analysis 
of the available information and clues may have been flawed, or some critical item may have 
been in error, causing search facilities to be sent to the wrong place. As POSc values continue

to rise without the search object being located, the possibility of an incorrect assessment of the 
available data or the presence of an erroneous data item must be taken more and more seriously. 
Assumptions are particularly susceptible to error. Their status as assumptions, and not facts, is 
easily forgotten if care is not taken to keep them separate from the known facts throughout the 
search planning process. Regular and frequent review and re-analysis of all available information

and clues will go a long way toward detecting false data items, preventing misinterpretation of 
correct data items, and improving the accuracy of the scenario(s) under consideration.
4.7.10 Summary. The strategy of maximizing the POS for each search provides important guidance to the 
search planner in determining where and how to apply the available search effort. Over time, it tends 
to move the search effort toward the survivors even if they are not initially in the cells having the

largest estimated POCs. Even if the probability maps and POC values are only approximate, using 
this strategy will produce much better results than not using it at all. When search object motion is 
not a consideration, developing and updating probability maps is relatively easy. When search object 
motion is involved, updating probability maps can become very complex. Section 4.8 discusses 
computer aids which may be available to assist the search planner with this and other complexities

in the search planning process. In the absence of such aids, the search planner should carefully make 
the simplifications needed to keep the problem manageable.
4.8  Computer-based search planning aids
4.8.1 As shown by sections 4.6 and 4.7 above, determining the best way to allocate the available search effort 
can involve a considerable amount of computation. The same is true for determining probability maps

for new datum lines or areas when there are significant variations in winds and currents. The number 
and accuracy of the computations which can be done by the search planner without a computer are 
necessarily quite limited. Computer programs can be used to great advantage in relieving the search 
planner of much of the computational burden, allowing more computations of greater complexity 
to be done in less time with greater accuracy. These programs can be made relatively small, simple,

and narrow in scope by limiting them to specific search planning functions. On the other hand, 
they can be quite large and sophisticated, addressing the entire search planning problem, including 
the optimization of search effort allocation over several search cycles. Such sophisticated software 
requires specialized expertise to develop and maintain. However, with a well designed user interface, 
it can be used by search planners with relatively little training.

4.8.2 Uses of computers in search planning. Computers may be used to perform computations in support 
of the following search planning functions:
 – calculate drift estimates, including leeway, local wind current, tidal currents, etc.;
 – calculate total probable errors of position, sweep widths, search endurances, search efforts, 
search areas, coverage factors, etc.;
 – create or record probability maps, update them and compute probability of success estimates

computers and computer-based aids do have their limitations, as discussed below.

judgement or analytical and coordination skills;
 – computer systems (hardware and software) must be properly maintained and replaced every few 
years, at some level of expense;
 – at least some training is required to master the operation of the computer and search planning 
software;

 – it is easy to become dependent on the computer and allow manual search planning skills to 
lapse; and
 – redundant computer systems, preferably at different sites to reduce the impact of a catastrophe 
at a single site, are required, especially if dependence on the computer is heavy.

Chapter 5
Search techniques and operations
5.1 Overview
5.1.1 The previous chapter described how to determine the optimal area where the available search effort 
should be deployed. Once the optimal search area has been determined, a systematic search for 
the search object should be planned. Before a search operation takes place, the search planner 
should provide a detailed search action plan to all involved facilities, specifying when, where and

how individual search facilities are to conduct their search operations. Coordination instructions, 
communications frequency assignments, reporting requirements, and any other details required for 
the safe, efficient and effective conduct of the search must also be included in the search action plan.
5.1.2 As a minimum, developing a search action plan consists of the following steps:
 – selecting search facilities and equipment to be used;
 – assessing the search conditions;

– assessing the search conditions;
 – selecting search patterns to cover the optimal search area as nearly as may be practical;
 – dividing the search area into appropriate sub-areas for assignment to individual search facilities; 
and
 – planning on-scene coordination.
5.2 Selection of search facilities
5.2.1 The types and numbers of available search facilities, along with their calculated sweep width(s),

determine how much search effort will be available at the scene. Small search efforts will result in 
correspondingly small probabilities of success, even when the effort is deployed in the most optimal 
fashion, and it will probably take longer to locate survivors. Since survival times may be limited and 
locating survivors almost always becomes more difficult as time passes, it may be necessary to seek

additional search facilities early in the search planning process. It is usually preferable to use larger 
rather than smaller numbers of search facilities for the first few searches. By doing this, survivors are 
often located sooner rather than later, and the need for a much larger, prolonged search effort is 
avoided. No matter how many search facilities the search planner tries to obtain, it is unlikely that so 
many will be made available that they cannot be used effectively.

5.2.1bis   In some cases – mass rescue operations, for example: see chapter 6 – ongoing search action may be 
required while rescue operations are also under way. The SMC should carefully select appropriate 
facilities for each part of the operation. Some units will be better suited to rescue work and others 
better employed in search activity.
5.2.2 Detailed factors for the SAR planner to consider in selecting search facilities are discussed in

appendix G. Search procedures and scanner techniques are presented in the International Aeronautical 
and Maritime SAR Manual for Mobile Facilities.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
5-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
5.3 Assessing search conditions
5.3.1 The graphs in appendix N used for determining the optimal search factor for a given amount of 
available effort, the probability of detection and the cumulative probability of success (POS c) all 
contain two curves. One curve is used for searches performed under ideal search conditions and the

other is used when search conditions are poor. The differences in the search plan and the attainable 
POS between ideal and poor conditions are usually significant. Therefore, it is important to accurately 
assess the search conditions. The two primary factors in determining search conditions are:
 – the sweep width, which in turn depends on a number of factors related to the search object, 
sensor(s) used, and environmental conditions; and

sensor(s) used, and environmental conditions; and
 – the ability of the search craft to accurately navigate its assigned search pattern.
 Sweep width
5.3.2 One of the primary indicators of whether search conditions are ideal or normal is the sweep width. 
Experiments have shown that sweep width decreases as search conditions deteriorate. Experiments 
have also shown that detection profiles under normal search conditions are generally lower and flatter

than they are under ideal search conditions. These results are also supported by search theory. In 
addition, search theory goes on to predict that probabilities of detection for the same coverage factors 
will be lower for searches performed under normal conditions than for searches performed under 
ideal conditions. Therefore, the corrected sweep width is important for two reasons. First, it is one of

the three factors which determine how much search effort is available (see paragraph 4.6.8). Second, 
when it is compared to the uncorrected sweep width for ideal search conditions, it may be used to 
determine how ideal or normal the actual search conditions are. The following list describes factors 
which separately, or in combination, may affect sweep width.
(a) The type of search object affects sweep width. Search objects are easier to detect when they

contrast significantly with their background. In daylight visual searches, the type, size, colour, 
and shape of the search object are important factors, while for night-time visual searches, search 
object illumination and reflectivity are important. In radar searches, line of sight, radar cross-
section, and signal strength are key factors. All search objects should be sought from a direction 
in which they receive the best illumination, colour brightness, or contrast.

(b)  Meteorological visibility is an important factor in determining sweep widths for visual searches. 
Meteorological conditions may reduce visibility in the search area or interrupt or prevent the 
start of search operations.
(1) In poor visibility, fog will make visual search ineffective if not impossible. Electronic 
search is normally the only appropriate means of detecting search objects from an aircraft,

although aural search can also be effective for boats and ground parties in small search 
areas. For example, survivors can sometimes be located by their cries for help in conditions 
of restricted visibility. For an aural search to be effective, searchers must remain silent for 
periods of time and remove all possible distracting noise by shutting engines down, turning 
off radios, etc. Dogs which rely on their sense of smell to locate survivors may also be used

effectively when visibility is low.
(2) Smog and haze may reduce the effectiveness of daylight search, while night signals are less 
affected.
(3) Low clouds may render search ineffective. For example, a ceiling of 150 m (500 feet) will 
not make search impossible but will normally reduce the sweep width and, consequently, 
the available search effort. However, low clouds normally do not significantly affect

searches conducted by surface facilities except where a thick overcast layer reduces light 
levels at the surface.
(4) Precipitation will reduce visibility and may prevent the search facility from completing 
its assigned search area. Snow or heavy rain will also make scanning from side stations

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 5-3
and use of searchlights and electro-optical systems limited or ineffective. Precipitation 
adversely affects both visual and radar searches.
(c) The type of terrain or conditions of the sea can affect sweep widths in almost all situations. On 
a flat area with little or no vegetation, a search object can be seen easily, while it may be very

difficult to detect the search object in a forested area or in mountainous terrain. On a smooth 
sea, any object or disturbance of reasonable size may be seen fairly easily, but whitecaps, foam 
streaks, breaking seas, salt spray, and the reflection of the sun tend to obscure a search object 
or reduce the chances of seeing it or its signals. Patches of seaweed, oil slicks, cloud shadows, 
marine life, or other distractions may be mistaken for a small search object such as a liferaft.

(d) The height of the lookout or other sensor above the surface can also have an impact on sweep 
width. It is not possible to prescribe a search height suitable for all situations. For vessels, the 
height of the bridge is usually the most suitable for lookouts. For aircraft, the highest reasonable 
search altitude above the surface is usually considered to be 450 m (1,500 ft) for daylight visual 
search. A search height of 150 m (500 ft) may be suitable for a helicopter or a slow fixed-wing

aircraft while impracticable for most jet aircraft. Table N-5 may serve as a guide in planning 
searches with helicopters and table N-6 may be used to estimate sweep widths for fixed-wing 
aircraft. Note that it is usually impractical to search for persons in the water from aircraft flying 
at altitudes greater than 150 m (500 ft).
(e) The time of day is another important consideration. The best time for visual searching during

daylight is from mid-morning to mid-afternoon, when the sun is at a relatively high elevation. 
Visual search at night will be futile unless it is known that the survivors have night signalling 
devices such as flares or lights, or can generate light in some other way such as by building a 
fire. However, where it is safe for search units to continue and active aids, such as searchlights, 
radar, infrared devices, low-light television, or night vision devices are available and usable, then

searches could continue.
(f) For daylight searches, the position of the sun is important. The searcher will see objects more 
easily and from greater distances when looking away from the sun. The effect of haze is much 
greater when looking towards the sun, so that objects on sea and land lose their distinctive 
colours and may be lost in a pattern of glaring light and shadows. Looking away from the sun,

the land and the sea are much darker, there is no glare, the haze is more transparent, white-
caps are highly visible, and all coloured objects tend to contrast more with their backgrounds. 
Therefore, search patterns should be oriented so that lookouts spend as little time as possible 
looking towards the sun. In any event, lookouts should be provided with sunglasses.
(g) Lookout effectiveness is crucial to visual searches. The effectiveness of lookouts depends on

their training, alertness and motivation, the suitability of their positions, the duration of the 
search, the roughness of the terrain for searchers on the ground, of the sea for vessel lookouts, 
and of air turbulence for aircraft lookouts. An adequate number of lookouts should be carried 
to ensure all quadrants about the search facility are scanned. On long searches, extra lookouts 
should be carried so rest periods may be provided to combat the effects of fatigue. For aircraft,

the search speed is important to lookout effectiveness because it affects the rate of angular 
(relative bearing) change as the aircraft passes by the search object. When the angular change 
reaches 30° per second, the ability to see a search object is reduced. By the time it reaches 
40° per second, the ability to see a search object is reduced to half the value associated with 
the same range and no angular change. When angular change increases, lookouts also tend to

look farther away from the aircraft in order to reduce the angular change. At a height of 60 m 
(200 ft) the highest search speed should be 110 km/h (60 knots), and at a height of 150 m (500 ft), 
the maximum search speed should be 280 km/h (150  knots) to ensure an effective search. 
(See the International Aeronautical and Maritime SAR Manual for Mobile Facilities for scanning 
techniques and for training of lookouts).

techniques and for training of lookouts).
5.3.3 Sweep width estimates for the marine environment are provided in tables N-4, N-5, and N-6, depending 
on whether the search facility is a merchant vessel, helicopter, or fixed-wing aircraft. Table N-7 gives

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
5-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
weather-based sweep width correction factors applicable to all types of search facilities. Table N-8 
gives additional sweep width correction factors for aircraft search facilities operating under conditions 
of reduced meteorological visibility. Sweep width estimates for searches over flat, open terrain are 
provided in table N-9. Search objects are more difficult to find in mountainous terrain or terrain

heavily covered with vegetation such as forests. Table N-10 gives sweep width correction factors to 
use when the terrain is not flat and open.
 Accuracy of navigation by search facilities
5.3.4 In addition to expanding the size of a search area, the navigational accuracy with which search 
facilities are able to complete their assigned search patterns has an important bearing on the coverage

of the area and the probability of detection. With one possible exception (boats searching for persons 
in the water, discussed further in the note following paragraph 5.5.5), dead-reckoning navigation alone 
generally produces poor results, particularly for search aircraft. Map-reading can be effective over 
land in visual meteorological conditions. In areas where navigation aids are limited, search patterns

should be selected so that greatest possible use is made of the aids that are available. Aircraft with area 
navigation capabilities can be used for all search patterns in all areas. Alternatively, patterns providing 
a reference point or a visual navigation aid, such as a vessel or a smoke float, should be considered. 
Coordinated air–surface searches with the vessel providing a navigation reference for the aircraft may 
increase search pattern accuracy, particularly in areas far from shore.

5.3.5 To be effective, search patterns must be accurately navigated. The size of the search facility’s probable 
position error relative to the size of the sweep width determines how much the probability of detection 
will be affected by the search facility’s navigational limitations. A position error of two miles is not 
usually significant if the sweep width for that search is 20 miles. However, if the sweep width is only

two miles, the effect of a two-mile position error on probability of detection will be substantial.
 Evaluating search conditions
5.3.6 Search conditions should be considered normal:
(a) whenever the corrected sweep width is less than or equal to one-half of the uncorrected value 
for a given search object and sensor under ideal environmental conditions; and
(b) whenever the search facility’s probable error of position (Y) is equal to or greater than the sweep 
width.

width.
 For example, the conditions for a visual search from a merchant vessel for a 12 m (40 ft) boat when 
the visibility is 9 km (5 NM) or less should be considered normal because the sweep width is less 
than one-half the value for visibilities of 37 km (20 NM). Table N-4 shows a sweep width of 8.3 km 
(4.5 NM) for a visibility of 9 km (5 NM), which is less than half the sweep width value of 21.5 km

(11.6 NM) for visibilities of 37 km (20 NM) or more. If a fixed-wing aircraft is being used to search for 
a 4-person liferaft from an altitude of 300 m (1,000 ft) on a clear, calm day and the aircraft’s probable 
error of position is 5.6 km (3.0 NM), search conditions should be considered normal since the sweep 
width for such a search is only 4.3 km (2.3 NM).
 Note:  Search conditions should be considered ideal only when the sweep width is at or near its

maximum value and the navigational error of the search facility is small in comparison to the sweep 
width. Search conditions are normal more often than they are ideal.
5.3.7 Procedures for computing sweep width from the sweep width tables in appendix N are included with 
the Effort allocation worksheet in appendix L.
5.4 Selecting search patterns
5.4.1 The basic technique for searching an area is to move lookouts and/or electronic sensors through the

area, using one of a few standard patterns. This technique has several benefits.
(a) A regular, organized pattern of search ensures the entire assigned area is covered more or less 
uniformly.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 5-5
(b) Regular patterns improve the probability of detection (POD) as compared to random, disorganized 
searching, especially when search conditions are ideal.
(c) Standard patterns are easier to communicate accurately and compactly with less chance of error 
or misunderstanding.
(d) Standard patterns make multiple-facility search efforts easier to coordinate.

(e) Standard patterns are safer to perform, especially in multiple-facility efforts.
5.4.2 The selection and orientation of a search pattern are very important and all pertinent factors should 
be considered before a selection is made. Search pattern(s) and their directional orientation(s) should 
meet the criteria listed below.
(a) They should be appropriate for the:
 – degree of uncertainty in the search object’s position;
 – navigational capabilities of each search facility;

– type of sensor(s) being employed;
 – primary type of search object or signal the search facility is attempting to detect and locate;
 – environmental conditions;
 – direction and rate of the search object’s predicted movement during the search; and,
 – time limits imposed by the survivors’ expected survival time, search facility endurance, 
availability of daylight, etc.
(b) It should be within the operational capability of each available search facility to accurately and

safely complete its assigned pattern.
(c) The expected result should be worth the estimated time and effort (see the discussion on using 
POSc in paragraph 4.7 .9).
(d) The selected search patterns should minimize the risk of collision with other search facilities, 
allow adequate fuel reserves, and avoid, where practicable, navigation hazards.
5.4.3 Close attention should be paid to air traffic in the area of the search. Normally more than one aircraft

should not be assigned to the same search sub-area at the same time. Multiple aircraft operating 
together in the same search sub-area distracts aircrew attention from the search and decreases the 
flexibility to respond to sightings or drop markers, flares, rafts, etc. This does not preclude an electronic 
search from taking place at high altitude while a visual search is done at a lower level. In fact, the

pilot in command of an aircraft doing a high-level electronic search may be an excellent choice for 
on-scene coordinator, or may be assigned as aircraft coordinator when multiple aircraft are involved.
5.4.4 When it is known or likely that a survival beacon may be available in the distressed craft or survival 
craft or be carried on the person of a survivor, an electronic search using an appropriate pattern

should be carried out by a fast aircraft flying at a high level while a visual search is carried out at a 
lower level or on the surface.
5.4.5 Search patterns coordinated between air and surface facilities offer a number of advantages. For 
example, the surface facility:
 – can act as an excellent navigational and reference datum for the search aircraft, particularly 
during maritime searches far offshore;
 – can be directed toward survivors as soon as they are located;

– can keep the aircraft informed of weather and other conditions at the scene;
 – may relay progress reports for the aircraft; and
 – can assist the crew of the search aircraft should a forced landing be necessary.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
5-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
5.4.6 The search patterns described below are arranged in the following four general categories:
 – visual search patterns;
 – electronic search patterns;
 – night search patterns; and
 – land search patterns.
 The most commonly used search patterns are also included in the International Aeronautical and 
Maritime Search and Rescue Manual for Mobile Facilities carried aboard all merchant vessels.

Search area coverage records
5.4.7 It is imperative that a record be kept of the areas searched. The crews of search facilities should plot 
actual search coverage as tracks are flown. One method of doing this is to shade or cross-hatch the 
areas searched and to outline the areas not searched on a map or chart of the appropriate scale. This 
information must be reported back to the SMC so the search may be evaluated, probability maps

and probabilities of success updated, and the next search planned. It is important that the SMC also 
receives information on how effective the search facilities considered their search to have been, given 
the search conditions at the time.
5.5 Visual search patterns
 Sector search (VS) 
5.5.1 Sector searches are most effective when the position of the search object is accurately known and the 
search area is small. Examples of this situation include a crew member seeing another crew member

fall overboard from a ship or a reported distress from a craft which provides a very accurate position. 
Sector searches are used to search a circular area centred on a datum point, as shown in figure 5-1. 
They are easy to navigate and provide intensive coverage of the area near the centre, where the search 
object is most likely to be found. Due to the small area involved, this procedure must not be used

simultaneously by multiple aircraft at the same or similar altitudes or by multiple vessels. Instead, an 
aircraft and a vessel may be used together to perform independent sector searches of the same area.

leg should then pass the marker at close range or directly overhead. When the sector search is used 
over a marker at sea, adjustment for the effects of total water current on the search object’s motion 
during the search is easier. The first leg should usually be down-drift. For aircraft, the search pattern 
radius usually lies between 5 NM and 20 NM. The angle between successive search legs will depend

on the radius used and the maximum track spacing at the ends of the search legs. For vessels, the 
search pattern radius is usually between 2 NM and 5 NM, and each turn is 120°. Normally, all turns 
in a sector search are made to starboard.
5.5.3 If the search object is not located by the time the sector search pattern has been completed one 
time, it should be rotated and repeated with the second set of search legs falling halfway between the

search legs followed during the first search, as indicated by the dashed search legs in figure 5-1.
 Expanding square search (SS)
5.5.4 The expanding square search pattern is also most effective when the location of the search object 
is known with relatively good accuracy. The commence search point (CSP) for this pattern is always 
the datum position. The pattern then expands outward in concentric squares as shown in figure 5-2,

providing nearly uniform coverage of the area around the datum. If the datum is a short line instead of 
a point, the pattern may be changed to an expanding rectangle. Due to the small area involved, the 
same cautions about the use of multiple search facilities as previously mentioned for the sector search 
also apply to the expanding square pattern.

5.5.5 The expanding square pattern is a precise pattern and requires accurate navigation. To minimize 
navigational errors, the first leg is usually oriented directly into the wind. The lengths of the first two 
legs are equal to the track spacing and the lengths of every succeeding pair of legs are increased 
by another track spacing. For successive searches in the same area, the direction of the search legs

should be changed by 45° as shown in figure 5-3.
 Note: Expanding square patterns are often appropriate for vessels, small boats or helicopters, but not 
necessarily fixed-wing aircraft, to use when searching for persons in the water or other search objects 
with little or no leeway as compared to the magnitude of the total water current. In such cases, it may 
be appropriate for the vessel or small boat to navigate the pattern by careful dead reckoning rather than

by precise electronic or visual navigation. Just as a sector search pattern automatically compensates for 
total water current when using a floating marker as a navigational reference, a vessel’s DR navigation 
of an expanding square also automatically compensates for the effects of total water current.

 Track line search (TS)
5.5.6 The track line search pattern is normally employed when an aircraft or vessel has disappeared without 
a trace while en route from one point to another. It is based on the assumption that the distressed craft 
has crashed, made a forced landing or foundered on or near the intended route and concentrates the

search effort near this datum line. It is usually assumed that the survivors are capable of attracting 
the search facility’s attention at a considerable range by some means such as a signalling mirror or 
coloured smoke (daylight), flares, flashing light or signal fire (night), or electronic beacon (day or night). 
The track line search consists of a rapid and reasonably thorough search along the intended route of

the distressed craft. The search facility may search along one side of the track line and return in the 
opposite direction (TSR), as shown in figure 5-4, or it may search along the intended track and once 
on either side, then continue on its way and not return (TSN), as shown in figure 5-5. Due to their high 
speed, aircraft are frequently employed for track line searches, normally at a height of 300 m to 600 m

(1,000 ft to 2,000 ft) above the surface during daylight or at 600 m to 900 m (2,000 ft to 3,000 ft) at 
night. This pattern is often used as an initial search effort because it requires relatively little planning 
and can be quickly implemented. If the track line search fails to locate the survivors, then a more 
intensive search over a wider area should be undertaken.

Figure 5-3 – Second expanding square search
5.5.7 Aircraft and ships of opportunity following the same or a similar route as that of the missing craft 
should be asked to divert to assist in the search. This will mean diverting to follow the distressed craft’s 
most probable route or a nearby parallel course. When multiple facilities are requested to assist in 
this manner, and especially if they are moving in opposite directions, the search planner must ensure

all facilities are aware of the presence of the others and avoid requesting facilities moving in opposite 
directions to follow exactly the same track on opposite headings. For aircraft of opportunity, track 
line searches should be regarded as additional to searches by SAR facilities with trained crews as an 
en-route aircraft may:
 – not carry sufficient or competent lookouts;
 – have to fly at normal operating levels and speeds rather than at optimum search heights and 
speeds; and

speeds; and
 – have to fly above clouds.

 Parallel sweep search (PS) 
5.5.8 The parallel sweep search pattern is normally used when the uncertainty in the survivor’s location is 
large, requiring a large area to be searched with a uniform coverage. It is most effective when used

over water or reasonably flat terrain. A parallel sweep search pattern covers a rectangular area. It 
is almost always used when a large search area must be divided into sub-areas for assignment to 
individual search facilities which will be on scene at the same time.
5.5.9 To perform a parallel search pattern, the search facility proceeds to the commence search point (CSP) 
in one corner of its assigned sub-area. The CSP is always one-half track space inside the rectangle

from each of the two sides forming the corner. The search legs are parallel to the long sides of the 
rectangle. The first leg is set at a distance equal to one-half the track spacing from the long side nearest 
the CSP . Successive legs are maintained parallel to each other and one track spacing apart. Figure 5-6 
illustrates a PS search pattern. Figure 5-7 shows how a PS search pattern can be navigated using a

hyperbolic navigation system such as LORAN. Figure 5-8 shows how to use distance-measuring 
equipment (DME) to navigate a PS pattern.
5.5.10 A parallel sweep search covering a single sub-area is normally performed by a single facility. As 
discussed in paragraph 5.4.3, the use of multiple aircraft working together in the same search sub-area 
at similar altitudes is discouraged. However, there are cases where multiple facilities may be used

to great advantage. Ships, fishing vessels, etc., which may be passing through or near the search 
area may be asked to divert along specific parallel tracks passing through the search area, as shown 
in figure 5-9, while maintaining a sharp lookout for the survivors. This type of search can be both 
effective and efficient. Similarly, en-route aircraft may be asked, via the appropriate ATS unit, to divert

through the search area along parallel tracks while listening for signals from an emergency beacon. 
However, for safety reasons, use of en-route light aircraft on VFR flight plans for visual search in the 
manner of vessels is not recommended.

 Creeping line search (CS)
5.5.11 The creeping line search pattern is basically the same as a parallel sweep search except that the search

legs are parallel to the short sides of the rectangle instead of the long sides. Because the CS pattern 
requires many more turns to cover the same area, it is usually not as efficient as the PS pattern unless 
it is used by an aircraft working in coordination with a vessel (see 5.5.12). Figure 5-10 shows a CS 
pattern.
 Creeping line search, coordinated (CSC)
5.5.12 A coordinated air–maritime search is usually accomplished by coordinating the movements of an

aircraft flying a creeping line search with those of a vessel moving along the major axis of the search 
area in the direction of the aircraft’s creep. The aircraft’s search legs are flown at right angles to the 
vessel’s track. The vessel’s speed, the aircraft’s speed, the length of the aircraft’s search legs and the 
track spacing are all planned so that the aircraft’s advance in the direction of creep equals the speed

of the surface facility. When correctly performed, the aircraft should pass directly over the vessel at 
the centre of each search leg, as shown in figure 5-11.

5.5.13 The relationship among the speed of the surface facility, the aircraft’s speed, the track spacing and the 
length of the search legs is defined by the following equation:
 V s = (S × Va)/(L + S)

V s = (S × Va)/(L + S)
 where Vs is the speed of the surface facility in knots, S is the track spacing in nautical miles, Va is the 
aircraft’s true air speed (TAS) in knots, and L is the length of the aircraft’s search leg in nautical miles.
 Contour search (OS) 
5.5.14 The contour search is used around mountains and in valleys when sharp changes in elevation make 
other patterns impracticable. The mountain is searched from top to bottom, never from bottom to

top. The search is started above the highest peak with the search aircraft completely circling the 
mountain at that level. To permit the aircraft to descend smoothly and safely to the next contour 
search altitude, which may be 150 m to 300 m (500 ft to 1,000 ft) lower, the aircraft may make a 
descending orbit away from the mountain before resuming the contour search at the lower altitude. 
When there is not enough room to make a circuit opposite to the direction of the search, the aircraft

may spiral downwards around the mountain at a low but approximately constant rate of descent. If, 
for any reason, the mountain cannot be circled, successive sweeps at the same altitude intervals as 
listed above should be flown along its side. Valleys are searched in circles, moving the centre of the 
circuit one track spacing after each completed circuit. Figure 5-12 illustrates a contour search pattern.

5.5.15 A contour search may be very dangerous. Therefore, extreme caution should be used when searching 
mountains, canyons, and valleys. The safety matters that should be considered are listed below.
(a) The crew must be very experienced, well briefed and have accurate large-scale maps (1:100,000 
scale maps are recommended).
(b) Mountainous search areas should be assigned to multi-engine aircraft whenever possible.

(c) During the search, all the pilot’s attention will be devoted to flying the aircraft. The pilot must 
evaluate forward terrain to avoid any hazard (such as power lines, cables, etc.) and anticipate 
the possibility of terrain-induced visual illusions which may jeopardize aircraft safety. When 
searching valleys, the pilot must plan ahead to ensure that the aircraft can either climb out of 
difficulty or turn around, knowing at all times which way to turn in case of an emergency.

(d) Weather conditions in the search area must be good. Both visibility and turbulence must be 
constantly monitored. Flights should be avoided in mountainous areas when winds exceed 
56 km/h (30 knots) because downdraughts can exceed 10 m/s (2000 ft/min).
(e) Before take-off, the crew should study large-scale contour maps indicating terrain elevations 
and contour lines. Areas of possible severe turbulence should be identified. Pilots should

determine turbulence and downdraughts before descending to search altitude and flying close 
to a mountainside (see paragraph 5.5.16). Wind direction and air current in mountainous areas 
may vary greatly. If turbulence is encountered, the pilot should take immediate steps to keep 
from exceeding the structural limits of the aircraft.
(f) Aircraft should not enter any valley which is too narrow to permit a 180 ° turn at the altitude

flown, unless a safe exit route is available ahead of the aircraft. Searches should be flown close 
to one side of a canyon or valley so that the entire width may be used if a 180 ° turn becomes 
necessary. A similar method should be applied when making a contour search of a mountain.
(g)  The aircraft should be highly manoeuvrable, have a high rate of climb, and a small turning radius.
(h) Only one aircraft should be assigned to each contour search area to avoid possible collision with

other search aircraft.
 Turbulence considerations for contour searches
5.5.16 Orographic turbulence may be found as updraughts on the upwind side of slopes and ridges and on 
the downwind side as downdraughts. The extent of the turbulence on the downwind side depends 
on the wind speed and the steepness of the slope. Orographic turbulence will be more intense when 
climbing a rough surface. The safest crossing of mountain peaks and ridges at low relative altitudes

under windy or turbulent conditions is downwind, where any downdraughts will be met after the high 
point in the terrain is crossed. If this is not practical, altitude should be increased before crossing these 
areas. The procedure to transit a mountain pass is to fly close to that side of the pass where there is an

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
5-14 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
updraught. This will provide additional lift and maximum turning space in case of an emergency, and a 
turn into the wind will be a turn to lower terrain. Flying through the middle of a pass may be dangerous 
as this allows the least turning space and, in addition, often is the area of greatest turbulence.
 Shoreline search

Shoreline search 
5.5.17 The marine equivalent to the contour search is the shoreline search. Small vessels, or aircraft capable of 
safely flying at low altitudes and speeds, are normally used in order to pass close enough to the shoreline 
to permit careful inspection. Vessels engaged in shoreline searches must be aware of navigational 
constraints and any limitations imposed by sea conditions. Search planners should consider the

possibility of survivors clinging to navigational aids such as buoys, or to rocks offshore. Survivors may 
make their way to any dry land they may drift close enough to see. Survivors may also anchor their boat 
or raft or tie it to an offshore navigational aid if they drift into shallow water but still cannot see land or 
believe they cannot make it to shore unaided. Search facilities should pay special attention to any such

possible places in their sub-areas where the survivors may have succeeded in arresting their drift.
5.6 Electronic search patterns
 Survival beacon search
5.6.1 When it is known or believed that an aircraft, vessel, or persons in distress are equipped with a 
survival beacon, an electronic search at high level should be initiated immediately whether or not any 
message has been received via the Cospas-Sarsat System (see section 2.6). In addition to EPIRBs and

PLBs operated by survivors, many aircraft carry ELTs that start operating when the G-forces reach a 
certain level, such as in a crash. The electronic search should not preclude the initiation of a visual 
search at lower levels since the success of an electronic search depends on the ability of the survival 
beacon to transmit a signal.
5.6.2 The sweep width in an electronic search should be estimated based on horizon range for the level

chosen for the search, since most emergency beacons operate on frequencies that may be received 
only by line of sight. However, if the probable detection range is known and is less than the horizon 
range, it should be used instead. When the probable detection range of a survival beacon is not known, 
the estimated sweep width over the sea or over flat terrain with little or no tree coverage should be

about one-half of the horizon range shown in table N-12. Over jungle areas and in mountainous 
terrain, the sweep width estimate may have to be reduced to as little as one-tenth of the horizon 
range. In mountainous terrain or areas covered with dense vegetation, the range of the signal will be 
reduced considerably as compared to the range over water or flat land.
5.6.3 Normally, a parallel sweep or creeping line pattern should be employed for survival beacon searches.

Although the detection profiles for electronic searches are likely to be different from those of visual 
search, the optimal search effort allocation techniques described in chapter 4 may be applied and 
should give results that are reasonably close to optimal. If the initial search of an area does not locate 
the beacon, the area should be searched again with the search legs of the second pattern oriented at

right angles to those of the first pattern. If the beacon remains unlocated but confidence is high that 
it is in the area and working, a third search with search legs parallel to those of the first search but 
offset by one-half of a track space may be considered. In mountainous areas, the first search should 
be arranged so the search legs cross the predominant ridge lines at right angles if at all possible.

5.6.4 One of the following procedures may be used to locate a survival beacon once it has been detected.
(a) For search facilities with homing capability, the search facility homes on the survival beacon as 
soon as the signal is detected. The survival beacon signal may be picked up quickly if the search 
facility proceeds towards the datum point where the search object location probability density

is the highest. If this is unsuccessful, a systematic search of the area will have to be made, using 
the sector, expanding square, parallel sweep, or creeping line search pattern with a track spacing 
based on the optimal value for the available search effort.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 5-15
(b) When reports are received of detections of a 121.5 MHz or 243 MHz signal from overflying 
aircraft (these signals are not processed by the Cospas-Sarsat System), a search area will need to 
be established so that an electronic search can be conducted for the beacon. Appendix S can 
be used for guidance on determining a search area and how that area should be searched.

(c) For aural electronic search by a facility without homing capability, a radio-frequency signal 
from a survival beacon is detected and converted electronically to an audible sound which at 
least one member of the search facility crew can hear via a speaker or earphones. The following 
procedures are normally used only by aircraft. (The procedures could be used by vessels but the 
lack of equipment for detecting the signal as well as the low height of the vessel make this a less

practical search technique.)
(1) In a map-assisted aural electronic search, the aircraft flies a “boxing in” pattern on the 
assumption that the area of equal radio signal strength is circular. The position of the 
aircraft is plotted on an appropriate map or chart as soon as the signal is heard for the first 
time. The pilot continues on the same heading for a short distance, then turns 90° left or 
right and proceeds until the signal fades. This position is noted. The aircraft now turns 180°

and once again the positions of where the signal is heard and where it fades are plotted. 
The approximate position of the survival beacon can now be found by drawing lines 
(chords) between each set of “signal heard” and “signal faded” positions, then drawing 
the perpendicular bisectors of each line and noting the position where they intersect. 
The aircraft can then proceed to that position and descend to a suitable altitude for visual

search. The construction of such a plot is shown in figure 5-13.

(2) With the time-assisted aural electronic search, the time when the signal is first heard is 
noted, but the aircraft continues on the same heading until the signal fades, when the time

is noted again and the length of time during which the signal was heard is computed as the 
difference between the two. The aircraft then performs a 180° procedure turn and returns 
along its original track in the opposite direction for half the amount of time just computed. 
At that point, the aircraft turns 90 ° right or left and continues until the signal fades. The 
aircraft then makes another 180 ° procedure turn and the time when the signal is heard

again is noted. The aircraft continues on that heading until the signal again fades, noting 
the time and computing the signal’s duration as the difference between the two times. The 
aircraft then performs a third 180° procedure turn and proceeds in that direction for one 
half of the last computed signal duration. It then descends to an appropriate altitude for 
visual search. Figure 5-14 illustrates the geometry of this procedure.

 Radar searches
5.6.5 Radar is primarily used in maritime search. Most available airborne radars would be unlikely to detect 
typical search objects on land except for metal wreckage in open areas such as desert or tundra.
5.6.6 The sweep width to employ in computing the optimal search area will depend on the type of radar,

height of the antenna, amount of environmental clutter and “noise”, radar cross-section of the search 
object, radar beam refraction due to atmospherics, and operator ability. It should be noted that when 
the wave height increases to above one to two metres (three to six feet), the probability of detecting 
a small search object rapidly decreases for most radars and, consequently, so does the sweep width.

For aircraft, the search altitude used should normally range between 800 m and 1,200 m (2,400 ft 
and 4,000 ft) for small search objects. The altitude used for large search objects should not exceed 
2,400 m (8,000 ft). It is advisable to consult with the pilot in command when estimating the aircraft 
radar’s sweep width and establishing a suitable track spacing for the existing search conditions.
5.7 Night search patterns
 Parachute flare searches

Parachute flare searches
5.7.1 Detection of survivors at night is unlikely if they have no night signalling devices such as flares or 
lights. The use of aircraft parachute flares does not appreciably increase the chance of detection. This 
type of illumination has very limited potential in searches for anything other than large objects located 
in well-defined search areas on flat land or at sea. It should also be noted that over land, a lookout will

be confused by silhouettes or reflections from objects other than the search object.
5.7. 2 Parachute flares should not be dropped over inhabited areas unless exceptional circumstances warrant 
their use. Flares should not be used over any land area unless there is no risk that a ground fire may 
be started. Flare usage over land is always subject to the prescribed procedures and policies of the 
State(s) where the search area lies.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 5-17
5.7. 3 Parachute flares are normally dropped from fixed-wing aircraft flying above and ahead of the search 
facilities. In this type of search, vessels and helicopters are the most efficient search facilities. Fixed-
wing aircraft will normally be less effective. Parachute flares should not be dropped in such a way

that casings or other material could fall on a search facility. It is essential to ensure flight separation 
between helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in these situations. If the flare is of the type which falls 
free after burn-out, the flare must be dropped in such a way that it does not burn out over a search 
facility. Flares must be handled with care by crewmembers familiar with their use.

(a) When helicopters are used as primary search facilities, it is essential to ensure a safe separation 
between them and the illuminating aircraft. Care must be exercised to ensure neither the flares 
nor debris from them collides with the searching helicopter. The searching helicopter normally 
flies into the wind or downwind at a height of 150 m (500 ft) and the illuminating aircraft drops 
the flare at a height which permits flare burn-out below helicopter height. The flare should be

dropped well ahead, and well above, the helicopter at the two o’clock or ten o’clock position, 
so that the observers can search for silhouettes and shadows in addition to searching the area 
directly illuminated by the flare. The distance between successive flares should be calculated so 
as to ensure that the area is thoroughly covered. The aircraft dropping flares should be carefully 
positioned so that it is in position to drop the next flare before the previous flare has burned out.

The helicopter pilot should be able to see the flare or flare-dropping aircraft when the flare is 
dropped. This technique is illustrated in figure 5-15.

(b) When a fixed-wing aircraft is the primary search facility, the chances of success are small even if 
the search object is large and conspicuous. Fixed-wing aircraft should be used only in extreme

emergencies, when no other type of search is available. The search is carried out in a way similar 
to that for helicopters.
(c) When a single surface craft is the primary search facility, the search is carried out by having 
the aircraft drop flares in a systematic pattern. Only large search objects on or near the surface 
facility’s course will have a reasonably good chance of detection. The aircraft should drop the

flare upwind of the vessel, off the bow. Flare burn-out should occur on the opposite quarter of 
the vessel. Illumination may be on one or both sides of the vessel. Figure 5-16 shows this pattern.
(d) When several surface search facilities are available, this procedure is used with a line-abreast 
formation. The spacing between the surface facilities depends on the size of the search object 
and on-scene conditions. The aircraft flies a racetrack pattern over the formation, dropping a

set of flares upwind so that they are over the formation during the middle of the burning period, 
and a new set is dropped as the previous set burns out. The number of flares to be dropped will 
depend on the length of the line of surface facilities. This pattern is shown in figure 5-17 .

 Search by infrared devices

Search by infrared devices
5.7.4 Infrared (IR) devices, such as IR TV cameras or Forward-Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR), are passive 
detection systems used to detect thermal radiation. They operate on the principle of detecting 
temperature differences to produce a video picture. Therefore, IR devices can often detect survivors 
by their body heat.
5.7. 5 IR devices are normally preferred for night use. For aircraft, search height should normally be from 70 m

to 150 m (200 ft to 500 ft) for small search objects such as persons in the water and up to a maximum 
of approximately 450 m (1,500 ft) for larger search objects or those having a stronger heat signature. The 
sweep width can be estimated based on the effective detection range as provided by the manufacturer.
 Night vision devices
5.7.6 Use of night vision devices (NVDs) can be effective in searches carried out by helicopters, fixed-wing

aircraft, rescue vessels, utility boats, and ground search parties.
5.7.7 The following factors may influence the effectiveness of NVDs for searching:
 – NVD quality;
 – crew training and experience;
 – environmental conditions (meteorological visibility, moisture, moonlight, cloud coverage, 
precipitation, etc.);
 – level and glare effects of ambient light (including natural light like moonlight and starlight, and

artificial light like illumination from search, navigation and other lights, inside and outside the 
search facility), and whether the light sources are within the NVD wearer’s field of view;
 – search-craft speed;
 – height of the observers above the surface;
 – surface conditions (like the presence of snow) and sea state;
 – size, illumination, and reflectivity of the search object (reflective tape on survivors or their craft 
can significantly improve the chances of detection with NVDs); and

– types of survival equipment or light sources (like signalling devices and pyrotechnics) used by 
the survivors.
5.7.8 Glare should be minimized as much as possible within the facility’s environment where the NVD 
users are stationed. This may involve opening or removing windows where practicable. Also, proper 
scanning techniques are important for reducing the adverse effects of moonlight or artificial light 
sources like light-houses, offshore rigs, ships, anti-collision lights, etc.

5.7.9 Visible moonlight can significantly improve detection of unlighted search objects when using NVDs. 
Search object light sources, like strobe or similar lights, or even cigarettes, can greatly improve 
detection even in poor visibility conditions such as light snowfall.
5.7.10 RCC staffs should be aware that sweep width estimates should take into account local conditions and 
the advice of the facility on scene.
5.8  Land search patterns

5.8  Land search patterns
5.8.1 The normal functions of land rescue facilities are to care for and evacuate survivors after they have 
been located. Search of large areas by ground parties alone is normally impracticable but may be 
used when aerial search is not possible or is ineffective, or when a closer examination of an area is 
desirable. Searching on the ground can be particularly effective in heavy forest or mountainous area.

Land search parties may also be used to locate survivors who have left the site of a crashed aircraft or 
grounded vessel.
 Visual search patterns for land search parties
5.8.2 Whenever possible, obvious natural or artificial landmarks such as rivers, roads, etc., should be used 
to delimit search sub-areas. This will help the search party considerably. Leaders of search parties 
should be equipped with large-scale topographical maps, preferably with a scale of 1:50000 or,

when these are not available, 1:100000. The search areas should be marked on these maps prior to 
commencing the search.
5.8.3 The search patterns used by land search parties are normally parallel sweeps or contour searches 
using a line-abreast formation. Variations and modifications of these patterns may be necessary to 
accommodate local terrain.

 Night vision devices
5.7.6 Use of night vision devices (NVDs) can be effective in searches carried out by helicopters, fixed-wing 
aircraft, rescue vessels, utility boats, and ground search parties.
5.7.7 The following factors may influence the effectiveness of NVDs for searching:
 – NVD quality;
 – crew training and experience;

– NVD quality;
 – crew training and experience;
 – environmental conditions (meteorological visibility, moisture, moonlight, cloud coverage, 
precipitation, etc.);
 – level and glare effects of ambient light (including natural light like moonlight and starlight, and 
artificial light like illumination from search, navigation and other lights, inside and outside the 
search facility), and whether the light sources are within the NVD wearer’s field of view;
 – search-craft speed;

– search-craft speed;
 – height of the observers above the surface;
 – surface conditions (like the presence of snow) and sea state;
 – size, illumination, and reflectivity of the search object (reflective tape on survivors or their craft 
can significantly improve the chances of detection with NVDs); and
 – types of survival equipment or light sources (like signalling devices and pyrotechnics) used by 
the survivors.

the survivors.
5.7.8 Glare should be minimized as much as possible within the facility’s environment where the NVD 
users are stationed. This may involve opening or removing windows where practicable. Also, proper 
scanning techniques are important for reducing the adverse effects of moonlight or artificial light 
sources like light-houses, offshore rigs, ships, anti-collision lights, etc.
5.7.9 Visible moonlight can significantly improve detection of unlighted search objects when using NVDs.

Search object light sources, like strobe or similar lights, or even cigarettes, can greatly improve 
detection even in poor visibility conditions such as light snowfall.
5.7.10 RCC staffs should be aware that sweep width estimates should take into account local conditions and 
the advice of the facility on scene.

been located. Search of large areas by ground parties alone is normally impracticable but may be 
used when aerial search is not possible or is ineffective, or when a closer examination of an area is

accommodate local terrain.

5-20 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
5.8.4 The parallel sweep search is the most common and effective type of land search pattern. Track spacing 
for lost persons is normally between five and eight metres. Search progress through wooded areas 
should be conducted at a slow pace so each thicket and depression may be checked. One square 
kilometre of woods can be searched by a land party of 20 to 25 persons in slightly more than 1.5 hours.

(a) A search party requires a team leader, two flankers and as many searchers as the terrain will 
allow. The team leader and the flankers should be equipped with large-scale topographic maps 
and a means of keeping in contact with one another and the on-scene coordinator.
(b) The search line is first formed along the search area boundary, with individual searchers 
positioned one track spacing apart. The control of the operation rests with the team leader, who

must ensure that the line is as straight as possible. To do that, the team leader must keep the pace 
equal to that of the slowest person in the line. If part of the team encounters an obstacle, or item 
of interest, they should investigate it while the rest of the team continues just past that point and 
stops to wait. When the investigators have rejoined the search line, the entire search line again 
moves forward on the team leader’s signal.

moves forward on the team leader’s signal.
(c) Boundary control of each successive sweep through an area is assigned to the pivoting flanker. 
During the first leg of the search, one flanker will try to follow a natural boundary or predetermined 
compass course while the other flanker marks the trail at the other end of the line. When the 
first leg has been completed, the line pivots about the number two flanker and proceeds in the

opposite direction on the second leg. This procedure is continued until the search area has been 
completely covered.
(d) The distance between each individual searcher (track spacing) is determined by the distance a 
person can effectively search while keeping adjacent searchers in visual and audible contact. 
This will ensure full coverage as well as give protection to inexperienced searchers. The track

spacing will depend on the search object size and colour, weather, and terrain. The team leader 
will make the final determination on what track spacing to use.
(e) Whenever contact with a searcher is lost, the team leader must be notified immediately. The 
search line will then stop until complete team contact is re-established.
5.8.5 The contour search is a modification of the parallel sweep search and is adopted when mountainous 
features can be circled completely.

features can be circled completely.
(a) The search begins with one flanker at the highest level and the other flanker at the low end of 
the line. When the mountain has been circled once, the line is re-formed on the lower side of 
the bottom flanker and the process is repeated until the search is concluded.
(b) The contour search is normally performed by one team leader, two flankers and up to 25 searchers.

(c) The team leader maintains overall control of the team, with the sweep boundary control assigned 
to the upper flanker.
(d) The general procedures as outlined in 5.8.4 above are also followed when making a contour 
search.
5.9 Search object motion
 Effects of search object motion on search patterns
5.9.1 Search object motion is an important consideration, especially in the marine environment. It has two 
primary effects.

primary effects.
(a) Search areas and patterns are normally based on the search object’s estimated location (datum) 
for the time at which search activities are scheduled to begin. If a search facility’s arrival in 
its assigned search sub-area is delayed for any reason, the datum on which it is based is no 
longer valid because the search object has continued to move during the delay. Similarly, a

search facility may experience mechanical or other difficulties and depart the search area before 
completing its assigned pattern, leaving a portion to be completed later.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 5-21
(b) Search patterns, when plotted relative to a moving object, may appear distorted. The effectiveness 
of a search pattern depends on how well the actual pattern, when plotted relative to the search 
object, matches the intended pattern.  For static search objects, the geographic plot of the 
pattern and the relative motion plot are always identical. For moving search objects, however,

the geographic and relative motion plots can be quite different.
5.9.2 If a search facility is going to experience a significant delay in starting its assigned search pattern, or 
must depart the search area without completing its assigned search pattern, the OSC and SMC should 
be informed as soon as possible. Depending on the sub-area affected and its POC value as compared 
to those of the other search sub-areas, it may be necessary for the OSC or SMC to re-assign the

search responsibilities to ensure the high-probability areas are covered first. For this reason, sub-areas 
should be prioritized in advance whenever possible. Ranking sub-areas in order of POC value will make 
any necessary reassignment decisions easier and more efficient and will reduce the impacts of delays 
and interruptions. It may also be necessary to move a delayed sub-area in the downdrift direction an

appropriate distance if this can be done safely while maintaining adequate separation of the search 
facilities.
5.9.3 For patterns that employ parallel tracks, maintaining the correct track spacing relative to the search 
object at all times is crucial to search effectiveness. Failing to account for the relative motion between 
the search facility and the search object can lead to non-parallel tracks and uncovered areas relative

to the search object. Figure 5-18 shows a PS pattern as it would appear relative to an object moving 
perpendicular to the search legs. If the search object had been in the area marked “Not Searched” 
(270 NM2 or 37 .5% of the intended search area) when the aircraft arrived at the commence search 
point, it would not have been found. The adverse impact on the POS for the search is likely to be 
significant. The reduced area that was covered had a higher coverage factor but a lower probability

of containing (POC) the search object. Unless the search object probability density in the missed area 
was very low compared to that in the covered area, the decrease in POC from not covering all of the 
intended area will outweigh any increase in POD that might have been attained in the portion that 
was covered. The resulting POS value will be lower, perhaps much lower, than intended.
 Note: An error in the estimate of the crosswind used in aeronautical navigation computations could

also distort the search pattern in the same way relative to a fixed object.

 Note: The search legs in the covered area were neither parallel nor equally spaced relative to the 
moving search object. Both these conditions are required for the “ideal search conditions” curve 
on the POD graph in figure N-10 to be valid, even when applied to just that portion of the sub-area 
actually searched. For search patterns distorted in this way, the lower POD curve should be used and

applied only to the area actually covered.
 Minimizing the impact of search object motion on search effectiveness
5.9.4 The simplest method for keeping search legs parallel and equally spaced relative to a moving search 
object is to ensure the search legs are parallel to the search object’s predicted direction of motion. This 
minimizes the impact of search object motion on track spacing when the pattern is plotted relative to

the search object. Figure 5-19 shows the relative motion plot of a PS pattern with search legs parallel 
to the direction of the search object’s motion. It should be noted that the area of the parallelogram in 
figure 5-19 is exactly equal to the area of the original rectangle. However, at one end of the intended 
search area, a small triangular portion was not searched. Note that the area missed (27 NM2 or 3.75%

of the intended search area) was only one-tenth of that missed in figure 5-18. If the survivors had been 
in the missed portion, they would not have been found. On the other hand, a triangular area of equal 
size was effectively covered outside the intended search area at the other end. The impact on the POS 
for the search will depend on the POC for the triangular area that was missed as compared to the POC

for the triangular area that was added at the opposite end. In any event, the impact will be much, much 
smaller than for the situation where search legs are perpendicular to the direction of motion.

 Note: Because the search legs remained parallel and equally spaced, either of the POD curves in 
figure N-10 may be applied to the parallelogram that was covered. The choice of POD curve will 
depend on other factors, as discussed in section 5.3.
5.9.5 When the search area has high-probability cells near a side that lies in the direction of search object

motion as viewed from the centre of the search area, the search planner should consider moving 
or extending the search area in the direction of motion by an appropriate amount to ensure these 
cells do not leave the intended search area before a search facility has a chance to search them. The 
amount of search area movement or expansion required will be determined by the search object’s 
rate of motion and the amount of time it will take to cover the search area. Figure 5-20 shows how a

search area could be extended in the direction of the search object’s predicted movement.

5.10 Assignment of search sub-areas to individual facilities
5.10.1 When planning a search involving several search facilities, the search planner has to simultaneously

balance a number of interrelated factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
 – size, shape, and orientation of sub-areas so the desired search area is covered;
 – type of search (visual or electronic) and coverage factors;
 – track spacing and orientation of search patterns;
 – maintaining safe separations between search facilities;
 – search endurances, operating ranges, required fuel reserves, and alternate aerodromes for 
aircraft;

aircraft;
 – transit times to and from the search area; and
 – search speeds.
5.10.2 Because all these factors are more or less equally important and modifying one impacts the others, 
there is no order of discussion or consideration which is preferable to all others. The search planner 
must consider all of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs to develop a practical search 
plan.

 Search area coverage
5.10.3 In chapter 4, the optimal area to search (A) was determined from the available search effort (Z) and 
the type of search object location probability distribution that was estimated or assumed. Using the 
universal definition of coverage factor (C) given in section 4.6, it is possible to compute the optimal 
coverage factor by:
 C = Z/A
 When search facilities are given an area to search, however, they are not normally given the amount of

area and the desired coverage factor. Instead, they are normally given a specific, detailed description 
of the search sub-area they are to cover and an equally specific, detailed search pattern to follow.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
5-24 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
Standard search patterns were described in section 5.8 above. The description and designation of 
search sub-areas are discussed in section 5.11.
 Track spacing
5.10.4 Most of the search patterns described in this chapter consist of equally spaced parallel search legs 
(tracks). The distance between adjacent search legs is called the track spacing. For these patterns, the

coverage factor (C) may be computed as:
 C = W/S
 where W is the sweep width and S is the track spacing. For parallel sweep searches, this formula is 
equivalent to the one in paragraph 5.10.3. If the sweep width and optimal coverage factor are known, 
the optimal track spacing may be found by:
 S = W/C
 Before a track spacing is assigned to a facility, care must be taken to ensure the facility is capable of 
accurately locating and following search legs at that spacing.

Adjusting track spacing
5.10.5 Increasing the track spacing increases the area which can be searched, but reduces the coverage 
factor and the probability of detection (POD). Decreasing the track spacing has the opposite effects. It 
decreases the area and increases the coverage factor and POD. Guidance was provided in sections 4.6 
and 4.7 for determining the optimal area to search with the available effort. As shown in paragraphs

5.10.3 and 5.10.4 above, this information can be used to find the optimal coverage factor and track 
spacing. However, the optimal track spacing from a theoretical perspective may not be the best 
choice from a practical perspective. Normally, some adjustment of the optimal track spacing will be 
required. Sometimes the computed optimal track spacing is too small for the search facility to follow.

Also, since it is desirable to have the widths of rectangular search sub-areas equal to a whole number 
of track spacings, adjustments are sometimes necessary, especially when the search planner needs to 
divide a search area into several adjacent sub-areas. If the optimal track spacing is used as a starting 
point, the adjustments needed to account for practical considerations will usually make the resulting 
search plan only slightly sub-optimal.
 Size of a search sub-area

Size of a search sub-area
5.10.6 To determine the maximum search area that may be assigned to an individual facility, the pilot in 
command of the facility if it is an aircraft, or the master of the facility if it is a vessel, must be consulted. 
Some of the factors to consider are listed below.
(a) The search planner should consider facility characteristics, such as:
 – facility’s search endurance and time available on task;
 – aircraft range at normal cruise power setting;

– aircraft range at normal cruise power setting;
 – aircraft required fuel reserve (alternate aerodromes, destination);
 – time to and from the search area; and
 – search speed (to determine time required to cover the area).
 Note: Pilots in command of aircraft should be cautioned that fuel consumption during search missions 
may be higher than normal, particularly in mountainous terrain. 
(b) The distance to the search area is important because the greater the distance, the shorter the

time available for search.
(c) The size of search area and track spacing determine how much time on scene will be required for 
the facility to complete its assigned search sub-area. Alternatively, the facility’s search endurance 
and the track spacing determine how much area can be covered.
(d) The type of search (visual or electronic) affects the choice of pattern and track spacing.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 5-25
 Note: For contour searches, the time required to complete the search area can be computed only by 
tracing the actual flight path on a map. 
5.10.7 When all these factors are known, it is possible to determine the area that can be covered by an 
individual facility in a given time. It is extremely important that each facility is allocated only an area

that it can cover on that sortie. The following formula can be used to determine the search endurance 
(T) required to search an individual sub-area:
 T = A/(V × S)
 where A is the area of the search sub-area, V is the speed of the search facility, and S is the track 
spacing. For several search facilities covering equal portions of the search area using the same search 
speed and track spacing, the search endurance required to cover the total search area (At) is given by

the following formula:
 T = At /(V × N × S)
 where N is the number of search facilities. If several search facilities are used which do not have the 
same search endurance, search speed, or track spacing, the time required to complete the search is 
equal to the longest of the times required to complete the search sub-areas. The area which can be 
searched by a facility based on its search endurance, search speed, and assigned track spacing may 
be found by the following formula:
 A = T × V × S

be found by the following formula:
 A = T × V × S
 The total amount of area which can be covered by several search facilities is the sum of the areas 
which can be covered by each of the individual search facilities.
5.10.8 The search area planning graph in figure N-9 may be used instead of the above formulas to find either 
the time required to search a given area or the area that can be searched in a given time. In using

either the formulas or this graph, the following items should be considered.
(a) At low levels, the indicated air speed (IAS) for aircraft is approximately the same as ground speed.
(b) At altitudes up to 600 m (2,000 ft) and a temperature ranging from +5°C to +35°C, true airspeed 
(TAS) for aircraft is approximately the same as IAS (when temperatures are higher or lower than 
this, the TAS should be used).

this, the TAS should be used).
(c) For the purpose of computing how much area can be covered, wind effects on aircraft are 
usually negligible because the tracks in most search patterns are reciprocal to each other. (When 
actually flying the search pattern, however, aircraft must correctly compensate for all wind 
effects, especially crosswind effects, to avoid search pattern distortions similar to those shown in 
figures 5-18 and 5-19.)
 Allocation of search areas for individual facilities

5.10.9 When sub-areas are allocated to individual facilities, care should be taken to ensure that each facility 
is used only in searches for which it is technically and operationally suitable.
(a) Short-range or medium-range facilities should be used for areas not far from a suitable base.
(b) Fast, long-range facilities should be used for distant areas or far offshore.
(c) Facilities with poor navigational ability should be used for searches with constant, or at least

frequent, visual references.
(d) Fast aircraft should be assigned search patterns which they can perform, for example, electronic 
or visual search along the intended track.
(e) Craft with the ability to rescue or assist survivors should be assigned to the higher probability 
sub-areas.
(f) The widths of rectangular areas to be covered with a PS pattern and the lengths of rectangular 
areas to be covered with a CS pattern should equal a whole number of track spacings.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
5-26 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
5.10.10 When assigning search patterns, care should be taken to ensure that each facility is assigned a pattern 
it can safely and accurately follow. Things the search planner should consider are listed below.
(a) Facilities should not normally be assigned search patterns with a track spacing less than the 
facilities’ minimum turning radius. If a high coverage is needed in a sub-area and attaining that

coverage on a single search requires a track spacing that is smaller than the facility can follow, 
the search planner should consider having the search facility cover the area twice at a larger 
track spacing that is within the facility’s capability.
(b) Whenever possible, search patterns should be oriented so the search legs are parallel to the 
expected motion of the search object during the search. Other factors which may influence

search leg orientation are the method(s) of navigation used by the search facility, sun angle, swell 
or ridge direction, wind direction, etc. The search planner should decide which factor is likely to 
have the greatest impact on POS and orient the search area, patterns, and legs accordingly.
 Search facility separation
5.10.11 Safe separations among the search facilities must be assured at all times. This is particularly critical

for searching aircraft due to their high speed. Adjacent search sub-areas, the search patterns used 
to cover them, and commence search points should be planned so that all search craft of the same 
general type (surface or air) are following parallel tracks and creeping in the same direction to ensure 
horizontal separation. Aircraft in adjacent sub-areas should also be assigned different search altitudes

to provide vertical separation. Vertical separation of aircraft in adjacent search sub-areas should be at 
least 150 m (500 ft). An aircraft coordinator (ACO) should be assigned whenever multiple aircraft are 
operating in close proximity.
5.11 Designation and description of search sub-areas
5.11.1 The following paragraphs describe various methods that may be employed by search planners to 
designate and describe search areas.
 Designation of search sub-areas

Designation of search sub-areas
5.11.2 For ease of reference in assigning search sub-areas and reporting search results, each search sub-area 
should be given a unique designation. One method for doing this is to use a letter and number 
combination, where the letter denotes the search day (“A” for the first day of search, “B” for the 
second day, etc.) and the number distinguishes sub-areas searched on the same day from one another.

Using this method, search sub-areas would be given designations such as A-1, B-3, C-2, etc. Almost 
any method may be used as long as it is understood by all participants.
 Description of search sub-areas
5.11.3 A number of methods exist for describing search sub-areas, depending on the type of datum, the type 
of pattern, whether the search is being conducted over land or water, the navigational capabilities of 
the search facility, etc.

the search facility, etc.
5.11.4 Geographical coordinate method. This is the normal method of describing an area. The corners of the 
area are defined by geographical coordinates of latitude and longitude. An advantage of this method 
is that areas of any shape can be described easily. However, the method is lengthy and subject to 
errors in transmission. For example:
 AREA  CORNER POINTS 
A-1   1547N 06512W, 1559N 06500W, 1500N 06403W, 1447N 06415W

Adding a checksum digit to each coordinate can make use of geographical coordinates more reliable 
by providing an opportunity to detect errors in transmission. Checksum digits are computed by adding 
all the digits in the coordinate and recording the last (least significant) digit of the result following the 
hemisphere designator (N, S, E, W). For example, the sum of the digits of the first latitude above is

1 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 17 so the checksum digit is 7 . The coordinates for area A-1 would appear as follows 
if checksum digits were used:
 AREA  CORNER POINTS 
A-1   1547N7 06512W4, 1559N0 06500W1, 1500N6 06403W3, 1447N6 06415W6
 If the receiving facility finds an incorrect checksum digit, an error has occurred and a retransmission 
of the coordinates should be requested. Most military facilities will recognize this checksum technique

but civilian facilities may require an explanation the first time it is used.
5.11.5 Centre point method. Any rectangular or square area can be described by giving the geographical 
coordinates of the centre of the area, the direction of the longer axis, the lengths of the longer and 
shorter axes and the direction of creep. For example:
MAJOR TRACK
CENTRE POINT LENGTH WIDTH AXIS SPACING CREEP
3417N 13622W 80 NM 40 NM 025T 5.0 NM 115T

3417N 13622W 80 NM 40 NM 025T 5.0 NM 115T
5.11.6 Track line method. A track line search area may be described by giving the relevant points on the track 
and the width of coverage. For example:
 SEARCH AREA: 2406N 05855W to 2450N 05546W, WIDTH 50 NM.
5.11.7 Landmark method. Description of search areas by natural and artificial boundaries is particularly 
suitable for searches in mountainous areas and for areas assigned to search facilities with limited 
navigational capability.

navigational capability.
5.11.8 Grid method. Many areas are divided into grids on local grid maps. Use of these grids permits accurate 
positioning and small area referencing without transmitting lengthy geographical coordinates and 
reduces the possibility of transmission errors. Such grids also often provide a convenient grid for 
probability maps (see sections 4.6 and 4.7) and it is efficient to use the same grid for both purposes.

5.11.9 Grid overlay method. The advantages of the grid method (see paragraph 5.11.8) may also be obtained 
by using a grid overlay for search facilities requiring the description of search areas. Grid overlays are 
most useful when all ships and aircraft involved in a search have a previously prepared grid overlay 
that is consistent with those of the other search facilities.
5.11.10 Various types of grid overlays can be used, made of transparent plastic material, for example, and

placed on top of a map. Figure 5-21 shows a simple version of a 64-cell grid overlay. As mentioned 
above, it is often both convenient and efficient to use the same grid for both probability maps and 
designation of search areas.
5.11.11 The centre of the grid overlay should be placed over the most probable location (datum point) of 
the missing aircraft or vessel. If all search aircraft or vessels have on board previously prepared grid

overlays, the search planner may direct them to orient the overlay on a given true bearing line, such as 
the probable track of the missing aircraft or vessel. Should another type of grid overlay than the type 
described above be used, it is at times more convenient to orient it north–south.
5.12 Planning on-scene coordination
5.12.1 When planning on-scene coordination, the SMC must try to maximize the efficiency of the operation 
while ensuring the safety of all facilities concerned.

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 5-27
1 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 17 so the checksum digit is 7 . The coordinates for area A-1 would appear as follows 
if checksum digits were used:
 AREA  CORNER POINTS 
A-1   1547N7 06512W4, 1559N0 06500W1, 1500N6 06403W3, 1447N6 06415W6
 If the receiving facility finds an incorrect checksum digit, an error has occurred and a retransmission

of the coordinates should be requested. Most military facilities will recognize this checksum technique 
but civilian facilities may require an explanation the first time it is used.
5.11.5 Centre point method. Any rectangular or square area can be described by giving the geographical 
coordinates of the centre of the area, the direction of the longer axis, the lengths of the longer and 
shorter axes and the direction of creep. For example:
MAJOR TRACK

MAJOR TRACK
CENTRE POINT LENGTH WIDTH AXIS SPACING CREEP
3417N 13622W 80 NM 40 NM 025T 5.0 NM 115T
5.11.6 Track line method. A track line search area may be described by giving the relevant points on the track 
and the width of coverage. For example:
 SEARCH AREA: 2406N 05855W to 2450N 05546W, WIDTH 50 NM.
5.11.7 Landmark method. Description of search areas by natural and artificial boundaries is particularly

suitable for searches in mountainous areas and for areas assigned to search facilities with limited 
navigational capability.
5.11.8 Grid method. Many areas are divided into grids on local grid maps. Use of these grids permits accurate 
positioning and small area referencing without transmitting lengthy geographical coordinates and 
reduces the possibility of transmission errors. Such grids also often provide a convenient grid for

probability maps (see sections 4.6 and 4.7) and it is efficient to use the same grid for both purposes.
5.11.9 Grid overlay method. The advantages of the grid method (see paragraph 5.11.8) may also be obtained 
by using a grid overlay for search facilities requiring the description of search areas. Grid overlays are 
most useful when all ships and aircraft involved in a search have a previously prepared grid overlay 
that is consistent with those of the other search facilities.

5.11.10 Various types of grid overlays can be used, made of transparent plastic material, for example, and 
placed on top of a map. Figure 5-21 shows a simple version of a 64-cell grid overlay. As mentioned 
above, it is often both convenient and efficient to use the same grid for both probability maps and 
designation of search areas.
5.11.11 The centre of the grid overlay should be placed over the most probable location (datum point) of

the missing aircraft or vessel. If all search aircraft or vessels have on board previously prepared grid 
overlays, the search planner may direct them to orient the overlay on a given true bearing line, such as 
the probable track of the missing aircraft or vessel. Should another type of grid overlay than the type 
described above be used, it is at times more convenient to orient it north–south.

Figure 5-21 – Simple version of a grid overlay
5.12.2 In planning on-scene coordination, the following actions should be taken:
 – designate the SMC;
 – designate the OSC;
 – designate ACO, as appropriate;
 – determine the on-scene time for search facilities;
 – assign search facilities, areas and patterns;
 – issue coordination instructions to the OSC and ACO;

– request airspace reservations;
 – request air and marine safety notices be issued as appropriate;
 – activate appropriate pre-arranged mutual assistance agreements;
 – designate primary and secondary communications channels; and
 – establish a situation report (SITREP) schedule between the OSC and SMC.
 Safety considerations for aircraft
5.12.3 Air search, except possibly electronic search, is normally carried out in visual flight conditions (as

opposed to instrument flight conditions). The SMC is responsible for developing a search action plan 
that provides for adequate separation among searching aircraft. It is the responsibility of the OSC and 
each pilot in command to ensure adequate separation is actually maintained during the search unless 
performance of this function is done by the ATS unit responsible for the airspace in which the search

aircraft are operating. To ensure that the necessary separation from other traffic can be provided 
while search aircraft enter, operate in, and leave the search area, the SMC must coordinate the search 
action plan with the ATS unit concerned and ensure flight plans are submitted for the search aircraft. 
Aircraft passing through the search area but not participating in the search should be directed to

maintain an altitude that is at least 700 m (2,000 ft) above the highest altitude assigned to searching 
aircraft. The SMC or, if that is not practicable, the OSC, may designate an aircraft coordinator (ACO) 
to assist in maintaining flight safety as discussed in chapter 1. Considerations as to whether an ACO 
is designated may include, but are not limited to, multiple aircraft in the search area, aircraft from

different countries, weather conditions, communications problems and logistic problems.
5.12.4 For large-scale searches and searches in controlled airspaces, the SMC should obtain a temporary 
airspace reservation or flight restrictions to limit aircraft not involved in the search from the appropriate 
authority. It may then be the responsibility of the SMC, OSC or ACO to make arrangements for 
separation among the search aircraft if they are unable to provide their own separation. Horizontal

and/or vertical separation should be provided for aircraft conducting visual searches in adjacent areas 
as described in paragraph 5.10.11 above. Aircraft conducting an electronic search may be separated 
only vertically. Vertical separation in this situation should be at least 300 m (1,000 ft).
5.12.5 The SMC should consider providing a fixed-wing escort for SAR helicopters whenever circumstances 
require these helicopters to operate:

require these helicopters to operate:
 – offshore or in remote areas, especially if near their operational range limits;
 – in marginal weather conditions (e.g. high winds, reduced visibility, icing, etc.);
 – in rough terrain where significant turbulence may exist;
 – near their maximum operational altitude for the situation (loading, air temperature, etc.); or
 – in any unusually hazardous situation.

– in any unusually hazardous situation.
5.12.6 The primary advantage of a fixed-wing escort is increased safety. Specific advantages contributing to 
increased safety may include:
 – increased navigational accuracy;
 – added communications capability;
 – the ability to immediately locate the helicopter in the event of a forced landing, drop survival 
gear, alert the SMC and possibly locate assistance (e.g. a passing ship);

– the ability to fly ahead, locate the survivors, and direct the helicopter to them, thus reducing the 
helicopter’s on-scene and total sortie times; and
 – the ability to fly ahead, observe environmental conditions and report them to the helicopter.
5.13 Search action plans
5.13.1 After an attainable search action plan is developed for accomplishment by the OSC and facilities 
on scene, it is provided to them in a search action message. Potential parts of the message are given

below. An example of a search action message is provided in appendix L with the Search Action Plan 
Worksheet. The message should include a situation summary of the on-scene situation, including the 
nature of the emergency, the last known position, search object description, types of detection aids 
and survival equipment which survivors may have, present and forecast weather, and search facilities

on scene. The message should include a listing of the search area(s) and sub-areas that can be searched 
by the search facilities in the allotted time. The message should assign primary and secondary control 
channels, on-scene, monitor and press channels, and special radio procedures, schedules, or relevant 
communication factors. It is better to release the message early. If a “first light” search is being planned,

parent agencies providing search facilities should typically receive the message at least six hours before 
departure time. The message can always be expanded or amended later.
5.13.2 The message normally includes six parts:
(a) Situation: includes a brief description of the incident, position, and time; number of persons on 
board (POBs); primary and secondary search objects, including the amount and types of survival

equipment; weather forecast and period of forecast; and search facilities on scene.
(b) Search area(s): presented in column format with headings for area, size, corner points, other 
essential data.

location, pattern, creep direction, commence search points, and altitude.
(d) Coordination: designates the SMC, OSC and ACO; search facility on-scene times; track spacings 
and coverage factors desired; OSC and ACO instructions, such as on the use of datum marker

buoys; airspace reservations; aircraft safety instructions; search facility change of operational 
control information if pertinent; parent agency relief instructions; and authorizations for non-SAR 
aircraft in the area.

identify OSC, ACO and search facilities (such as radar transponder codes); and press channels.

(f) Reports: requirements for OSC and ACO reports of on-scene weather, progress, and other 
SITREP information; and for parent agencies to provide at the end of daily operations, such as 
sorties, hours flown, hours and area(s) searched, and coverage factor(s).
 A sample search action message is provided in appendix L.
5.14 Conduct of the search
5.14.1 There are a number of activities which are important to the conduct of search operations. These

activities include briefing of search personnel, procedures to be followed when entering, operating in, 
and departing the search area, and debriefing search personnel.
5.14.2 The importance of briefings, debriefings and following standard or prescribed procedures should not 
be underestimated, especially when several facilities will be operating simultaneously in adjacent 
search sub-areas. For safety reasons, each facility should be briefed on the intended locations of all

other nearby facilities at all times, including periods of transit to or from the search area. Lookouts will 
be more effective if they have a precise description of the search object. Often detailed descriptions, 
drawings, photographs, etc., of the same or similar objects can be most effectively communicated 
in briefings. Any last minute coordination details or questions about procedures can be resolved at

briefings. Debriefings are essential for obtaining detailed information about any clues that were sighted 
and getting an accurate description of the actual search conditions encountered for the purpose of 
estimating search effectiveness (POS and POSc).
5.15 Briefings
5.15.1 Briefing of SAR personnel should, if possible, be held in sufficient time before departure. SAR personnel 
should be given all relevant details of the distress and all instructions for the SAR operation. Time

permitting, this may be done by issuing a search operation briefing/tasking form to the crew, giving as 
much information as possible (see appendix H). Situation updates should be provided to the search 
facility en route. Descriptive information regarding merchant vessels and small craft is given in the 
Maritime Search and Rescue Recognition Code (MAREC) in appendix I. If the SMC receives additional

pertinent information after the briefing, the information should be passed to facilities en route or on 
scene.
 Briefing of air search personnel
5.15.2 Briefings should include all items detailed on the briefing form in appendix H and any other important 
information available, and should include:
 – a full description and nature of distress;
 – full details of the search area(s) and any description of clues that may indicate the presence of 
the search object, including:

the search object, including:
 – distress signals and visual signal codes (listed in appendix A) that survivors might use to 
attract attention or communicate their status or direction of movement;
 – broken tree tops;
 – wreckage;
 – dye markers, burnt patches, oil slicks;
 – smoke;
 – signs of a landslide or other unusual occurrence affecting the terrain;
 – coloured or white objects; and
 – reflections from metal or glass;

– reflections from metal or glass;
 Note: Details that are already known to be of no significance for the present search, such as 
locations of wreckage from previous unrelated incidents, should also be pointed out.
 – type and method of search and method to record areas searched;
 – details of other SAR facilities engaged and their search or other operating areas;
 – communication procedures and frequencies to be used;
 – frequencies to be guarded for transmissions from survivors;

– special instructions concerning the flight to and from the search area, including routes and levels;
 – details of droppable supplies to be carried and any special dropping procedures;
 – action to be taken on sighting the search object;
 – flight separation instructions;
 – precautions to be taken when dropping pyrotechnics;
 – present and forecast weather conditions to, from and in the search area, and at destination and 
alternate aerodromes; and
 – designation of OSC and ACO.

– designation of OSC and ACO.
  These details are included in the Briefing Form in appendix H. Trained and experienced search crews 
will not normally require details on search procedures; however, untrained or volunteer searchers may 
require additional information concerning search procedures to optimize their search effort.
 Briefing of surface search personnel
5.15.3 Briefing of surface search personnel should cover all items similar to that of air personnel, except that

emphasis should be given to matters of interest to surface facilities. To ensure effective coordination 
of surface searches, radiocommunication equipment should be used to exchange information during 
the search operation.
5.16 Aircraft search procedures
5.16.1 Aircraft are the most capable facilities for searching a large area quickly. As each aircraft has its 
operational and technical limitations, the urgency of a situation should never cause an aircraft to be

used beyond these limits or on operations for which it is not suitable. Reliable communications between 
aircraft and the controlling agency are essential to keep all parties aware of the progress of the search. 
In areas of poor radio reception or when working beyond the range of CRSs, a high-flying aircraft or 
a surface craft with an appropriate communications capability can serve as a central communications

facility. Situation reports (SITREPs) should be sent to the controlling RCC at the intervals specified in the 
search action plan. An example of a SITREP is provided in appendix I. Detailed in-flight procedures, 
including scanning techniques, are included in the International Aeronautical and Maritime SAR 
Manual for Mobile Facilities.
5.17 Surface facility search procedures
5.17.1 When surface facilities are used for search operations, they must be capable of carrying out the

operation in the prevailing and forecast sea and weather conditions for the search area. Complete 
procedures for surface craft, including scanning techniques, are found in the International Aeronautical 
and Maritime SAR Manual for Mobile Facilities.

will not normally require details on search procedures; however, untrained or volunteer searchers may 
require additional information concerning search procedures to optimize their search effort.

5.18 Search by land facilities
5.18.1 The same basic theory of search applies on land as well as in the marine environment. In both cases, 
the goal is to increase the cumulative POS as quickly as the available resources will allow. However, 
the planning methods and search techniques used on land are often different from those used in the

marine environment. If the initial search object is a forced landing site, then search object motion is 
not likely to be an issue. If the search object is a lost or missing person, whether from a forced landing 
site or some other circumstance such as a lost hiker, hunter or child, search object motion may be 
an issue.  However, in these cases, the influences of the lost person’s behaviour, weather, terrain and

vegetation take the place of winds, currents and drift. Aerial search effectiveness is reduced over areas 
that are mountainous or covered with significant amounts of vegetation.  Searching with land facilities 
may be the only alternative. Land facility search procedures are covered in the IAMSAR Manual, 
volume III, Mobile Facilities.
5.18.2 Searching for lost persons with ground parties may involve large numbers of searchers. Logistics

(keeping track of searchers and providing food and shelter for them) can become quite complex, 
especially in remote areas. Search environments, and hence sweep width values, can vary dramatically 
over short distances such as when pasture lands and dense forests are adjacent to one another. Search 
assignments normally involve small teams of persons.  Search areas are based on terrain, vegetation, 
a corresponding estimated search speed, sweep width, etc. Decisions about which areas to search

when there are insufficient search facilities should be determined by where the cumulative POS can 
be increased at the greatest rate. Search area boundaries are normally defined by physical features 
such as ridgelines, water boundaries, roads, trails, fences, visible power lines and pipelines, etc. These 
search areas may have irregular shapes. Decisions about the best balance between team size (number

of persons) and assigned area size must be made. Additional “search” techniques include searching 
for signs of the lost person’s passage (footprints, discarded items, disturbed vegetation, etc.), the use 
of trackers, both human and animal, and establishing a perimeter around the overall search area, then 
patrolling it for signs that the lost person crossed the perimeter and left the original search area.
5.18.3 Search effectiveness can be improved by combining air assets with ground parties.

5.19 Debriefing of search personnel
5.19.1 A timely and comprehensive debriefing of search crews is as important as the briefing. A careful 
debriefing and evaluation of the reports of search crews is necessary for an accurate evaluation of the 
search activities. This evaluation in turn will determine if and where further searching should be done. 
Areas covered during the search should be recorded on the plot in the RCC. The information obtained

should be entered on the SAR briefing and debriefing form (see appendix page H-1).
5.19.2 All relevant debriefing information should be plotted on a chart showing the search area or areas. A 
careful study of the data will enable the SMC to update probability of containment (POC), probability 
of success (POS), and cumulative probability of success (POSc) values (see chapter 4), and use them 
together with other information to determine whether an area has been sufficiently searched.

5.20 Continuation of search 
5.20.1 The SMC should continue the search until all reasonable hope of rescuing survivors has passed. As 
the search progresses it may be necessary to re-evaluate scenarios and redefine the search area. Plots 
of search sub-areas covered should be maintained so that a progressive record of the search is built 
up. Before terminating or suspending search activities, the SMC should review the following factors:

– the possibility that survivors might still be alive, given the temperature, wind, and sea conditions 
prevalent since the distress incident;
 – the cumulative probability of success (POSc); and
 – the availability of search facilities to continue the search.
5.20.2 Recommended procedures to follow during the conclusion of SAR operations are discussed in chapter 9.
5.21 Geographic referencing

5.21 Geographic referencing
5.21.1 If position information is communicated in latitude and longitude format in the planning and conduct 
of a SAR operation, it is recommended that the degrees, minutes, decimal minutes (DD ° MM.mm’) 
format be used.
5.21.2 Geographic referencing refers to the ability to locate a point on the earth’s surface, either physically 
or on a chart or map. A system of coordinates is used to define a location in physical space. Mariners

and aviators typically use latitude and longitude to define their position but these coordinates can 
be displayed in different ways and people on land may use a different coordinate system, such as 
a grid system. On land, after a major disaster or in undeveloped areas, landmarks and navigational 
aids, such as roads, may not be recognizable so the use of a coordinate system may be the only way

to find specific locations. Search facilities must have a good geographic reference system to conduct 
an effective search as well as to safely operate near each other, especially to avoid airspace traffic 
conflicts.
5.21.3  Charts and maps have two primary difficulties in providing a location: 
(a) showing the earth’s spherical shape as a flat surface, and 
(b) the earth is not a perfect sphere.

(b) the earth is not a perfect sphere.
  Another complication is States using a different basis or datum for developing charts. Also, land maps 
may use a local reference point to show positions on the basis of grid distances (usually east and 
north in metres) from the reference point. These concerns usually do not interfere with routine, local 
SAR operations but they can become significant concerns when assisting other States or coordinating

with local authorities during disasters. Search planners and SAR facilities need to be aware of these 
differences and, when feasible, should be using the same charts and maps as well. If it is not possible for 
all personnel and facilities to use the same coordinate system and maps or charts, the SMC should be 
prepared to convert position data from one system to another and ensure positions are provided in the

appropriate form for use. SAR facilities and personnel using electronic navigation systems (e.g. GNSS) 
must ensure their navigation devices are set to the appropriate datum and coordinate system.
5.21.4 For routine SAR operations, mass rescue operations or large-scale disasters, SAR agencies must be 
able to understand how geographic information is communicated among the SMC, OSC, ACO and 
various SAR facilities. This becomes an even greater challenge when SAR facilities transition between

maritime and land-based SAR operations or in large-scale disaster operations that involve many 
different SAR facilities that may have different ways to communicate position information. In the 
development of State and regional SAR plans, States should consider concerns such as:
 –  How does the SMC effectively use position information from external sources (e.g. general 
public, other agencies (non-emergency and emergency), etc.) and communicate that position

information accurately and efficiently to various aeronautical, marine or land-based SAR facilities 
in forms they can use?
 –  Do States have unique, national coordinate systems that may not be familiar to other international 
SAR facilities requested to assist in a SAR, MRO or disaster response operation?  
 –  What is the “right” reference system that should be used for a specific SAR, MRO or disaster 
response operation?

response operation?
 –  Is there only one reference system that satisfies the requirements of all SAR facilities? If there is 
more than one reference system, how is the data translated and sent to the various SAR facilities?
 –  How and when is position information in one reference system converted to another?  
 –  How is position information received in non-standard formats (street addresses, landmark names, 
etc.) converted to a standard reference format?

etc.) converted to a standard reference format?
 –  In large-scale MRO and disaster operations, how do SAR facilities navigate when landmarks 
such as street signs and homes are destroyed?

different SAR facilities that may have different ways to communicate position information. In the 
development of State and regional SAR plans, States should consider concerns such as:
 –  How does the SMC effectively use position information from external sources (e.g. general 
public, other agencies (non-emergency and emergency), etc.) and communicate that position

information accurately and efficiently to various aeronautical, marine or land-based SAR facilities 
in forms they can use?
 –  Do States have unique, national coordinate systems that may not be familiar to other international 
SAR facilities requested to assist in a SAR, MRO or disaster response operation?  
 –  What is the “right” reference system that should be used for a specific SAR, MRO or disaster 
response operation?

response operation?
 –  Is there only one reference system that satisfies the requirements of all SAR facilities? If there is 
more than one reference system, how is the data translated and sent to the various SAR facilities?
 –  How and when is position information in one reference system converted to another?  
 –  How is position information received in non-standard formats (street addresses, landmark names, 
etc.) converted to a standard reference format?

etc.) converted to a standard reference format?
 –  In large-scale MRO and disaster operations, how do SAR facilities navigate when landmarks 
such as street signs and homes are destroyed?

Chapter 5 – Search techniques and operations
5-34 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 –  How do multiple SAR facilities safely and efficiently operate in the same area, particularly for 
mass rescue operations? For aeronautical SAR facilities, avoiding airspace traffic conflicts is a 
major safety issue to prevent mid-air collisions. The safe operation of multiple aviation SAR 
facilities in the same area may be highly dependent on all units having a common and accurate

sense of their location in relation to other aviation units.
5.21.5 Latitude and longitude are angular measurements in degrees (the symbol, “°”), minutes (the apostrophe 
symbol, “ ‘ “), and seconds (the quotation symbol, “ “ ”). However, latitude and longitude can be read 
and written in different formats such as: 
 – degrees, minutes, decimal minutes (DD° MM.mm’); 
 – degrees, minutes, seconds (DD° MM’ SS”); and
 – degrees, decimal degrees (DD.DDDD°).

– degrees, decimal degrees (DD.DDDD°).
  The SC should standardize how position information is communicated by the SMC, OSC, ACO and 
SAR facilities to limit confusion in assignments (e.g. search areas, survivor locations, etc.) and SAR 
planning.

Rescue planning and operations
6.1 General
6.1.1 When the search object has been located, the SMC (or the OSC or master or pilot in command of 
the SAR facility as the case may be) must decide on the method of rescue to be followed and the 
facilities to be used. The following factors should be considered:
 – action taken by the sighting craft and the SAR action which can be taken by other craft on scene;

– location and disposition of the survivors;
 – condition of survivors and medical considerations;
 – number of persons reported to be on board the distressed craft and the number who have 
been located;
 – environmental conditions, observed and forecasted;
 – available SAR facilities and their state of readiness (to reduce delay, the SAR facilities which 
are likely to be used should be alerted and deployed to a suitable location while the search is 
in progress);

in progress);
 – effect of weather conditions on SAR operations;
 – time of day (remaining daylight) and other factors relating to visibility; and
 – any risks to SAR personnel, such as hazardous materials.
6.1.2 In times of armed conflict, SAR services will normally continue to be provided in accordance with 
the Second Geneva Convention of 1949 (Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition 
of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of the Armed Forces at Sea, of 12 August 1949) and

Additional Protocol I to the Conventions.
(a) The SAR services recognized by their Administrations are afforded protection for their 
humanitarian missions so far as operational requirements permit. Such protection applies to 
coastal rescue craft, their personnel, and fixed coastal SAR installations, including RCCs and 
RSCs as far as these centres are located in coastal areas and are used exclusively to coordinate

search and rescue operations. SAR personnel should be informed about their Administration’s 
status regarding, and views on the implementation of, the Second Geneva Convention and its 
Additional Protocol I.
(b) Chapter XIV of the International Code of Signals illustrates the different means of identification 
that shall be used to provide effective protection for rescue craft.
(c) The above-mentioned coastal installations should, in time of armed conflict, display the

distinctive emblem (red cross, red crescent or red crystal) according to regulations issued by 
their competent authorities.
(d) It is recommended that Parties to a conflict notify the other Parties with the name, description 
and locations (or area of activity) of their above-mentioned rescue craft and coastal installations 
in the area they are located.
 Note: The guidance in paragraph 6.1.2 above has been approved by the International Committee of

the Red Cross. For further guidance, see volume I, chapter 1.8.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
6.2 Sighting and subsequent procedures
6.2.1 When the search object has been located, ensure that the search facility (or rescue team if it is 
a land-based facility) understands that the rescue of survivors may be even more difficult and 
hazardous than the search. The search facility should indicate to the survivors that they have been 
sighted, by any of the following methods:

sighted, by any of the following methods:
 – flashing a signalling lamp or searchlight; or
 – firing two, preferably green, signal flares a few seconds apart; or
 – if the search facility is an aircraft, the pilot may be able to fly low over the survivors with 
landing lights on or rocking the wings.
6.2.2 If the search facility is unable to effect an immediate rescue, ensure that it knows it may consider 
other steps such as:
 – dropping communications and survival equipment;

– keeping the distress scene in sight at all times, thoroughly surveying the scene and accurately 
plotting its location, and marking it with a dye marker, smoke float or floating radio beacons;
 – reporting the sighting to the SMC with available information on:
 – time of sighting – time zone to be specified;
 – position of the search object;
 – description of the distress scene;
 – number of sighted survivors and their apparent condition;
 – apparent condition of the distressed craft;

– apparent condition of the distressed craft;
 – supplies and survival equipment required by survivors (in general, supply of water should 
take priority over that of food);
 – all messages, including radio transmissions, received from survivors;
 – weather and, if applicable, sea conditions;
 – type and location of nearby surface craft;
 – action taken or assistance already given, and future actions required;

– remaining fuel and on-scene endurance of search facility or land facility making the 
report; and
 – apparent risks involved in the rescue, including hazardous materials.
6.2.3 The SMC may also request the search facility to:
 – establish the location of stretches of land or water suitable for use by aircraft, pararescuers, and 
paramedics and the best route for use by a land facility;
 – direct rescue facilities and other aircraft to the distress scene;

– if the search facility is an aircraft, take photographs of the distressed craft from normal search 
heights and directions, from a low level, and from an angle, taking in prominent landmarks, if 
possible; and
 – remain on scene until relieved, forced to return to base, or rescue has been effected.
6.3 Delivery of rescue personnel and equipment
6.3.1 Maritime SRUs are a reliable means of delivering supplies, equipment, and personnel to the scene of

a distress. Equipment may include portable pumps, towing equipment, fire-fighting equipment, and 
medical supplies. Personnel delivery may include firefighting, medical and/or salvage personnel or 
repair and support parties.
6.3.2 Air delivery of supplies, equipment, or personnel to the distress scene is usually the most expeditious 
method. Helicopters are particularly suitable for this purpose and are usually the primary means for

delivering personnel. Personnel delivery by fixed-wing aircraft is limited to specialists.
6.3.2bis MSC.1/Circ.1183 provides further guidance on the provision of external support as an aid to incident 
containment, and appendix G to this volume includes further information on supplies and survival 
equipment.
6.3.3 SRUs should carry a variety of rescue equipment at all times, but SAR boats and helicopters are

limited due to their size. An SRU should be provided with rescue equipment suitable for individual 
operations. A supply of commonly required equipment should be maintained at the permanent 
bases of SRUs. This includes equipment designed for supply dropping by aircraft.
6.3.4 Illumination of the scene of operation is required at night. All SRUs should be capable of providing 
this. Illumination could involve the use of parachute flares or high-intensity searchlights. Section 5.7

provides additional information.
6.4 Supplies and survival equipment
6.4.1 Supplies and survival equipment are carried by air and maritime SAR facilities to aid survivors, and 
facilitate their rescue. The type and number to be carried depend on the circumstances on scene. 
Maritime facilities and helicopters generally can deliver this equipment directly to survivors. Fixed-
wing aircraft can deliver supplies to survivors if suitable landing areas exist nearby or if the supplies

can be dropped at the scene. The packing of supplies and survival equipment should be adapted to 
the manner of delivery.
6.4.2 Packs of supplies and survival equipment must be adapted to the circumstances of the SRR in which 
they are used. Appendix G provides a guide of recommended supplies and survival equipment that 
SRUs may be expected to provide. Other SAR facilities may not have such supplies and equipment.

6.4.3 Droppable containers and packages. The type and dimensions of droppable containers or packages 
will vary with the type and quantities of equipment to be dropped (dictated by the number of 
survivors and their requirements); the size and type of the delivering aircraft; the manner of delivery 
(e.g. parachute or free-drop from wing racks or through hatches, let down from helicopters, etc.); and

the surface conditions. Containers and packages of supplies and survival equipment should be strong, 
easy to open, of a highly visible colour, waterproof, and buoyant. Containers are normally cylindrical 
and can be made economically of a light metal alloy, such as aluminium, or of plastic-coated three-
ply corrugated cardboard. Packages may consist of bags made of heavy canvas reinforced with

webbing and cardboard stiffeners. If it is necessary to drop large quantities of liquids separately from 
other items, suitable containers should be filled to no more than nine-tenths of capacity to prevent 
bursting. Drinking water may be free-dropped in suitable containers. Other considerations include:
(a) Items of a non-fragile and robust nature may be free-dropped into water or other favourable

areas provided their packing will be able to withstand the shock and is watertight and buoyant. 
It is usually better to attach parachutes. The parachutes need not be of the same standard as 
those used by air crews and may be economically made from obsolete aircrew parachutes, or 
from a suitable and inexpensive cloth.
(b) The contents of each container or package should be clearly indicated in print in English and

additional languages appropriate to the intended area of operation or using self-explanatory 
symbols, and may also be indicated by pictograms discussed in appendix G, section G-7 .
(c) Instructions on the use of survival equipment should be enclosed in each of the droppable 
containers or packages. They should be printed in English and one or more other languages 
appropriate for the area, using self-explanatory diagrams and symbols wherever possible.

6.4.4 Storage and inspection. Since it may not be economical to provide all facilities with supplies and 
survival equipment, storage depots may be established at appropriate locations. These depots could

appropriate for the area, using self-explanatory diagrams and symbols wherever possible.

6.4.4 Storage and inspection. Since it may not be economical to provide all facilities with supplies and 
survival equipment, storage depots may be established at appropriate locations. These depots could

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
also be used to store equipment that should be available to SRUs if not already carried by them as 
discussed in chapter 5.
(a) An adequate number of packs of supplies and survival equipment should be kept at aerodromes 
and ports from which SRUs normally operate. In addition, packs may be stored at redeployment 
bases and at aerodromes and ports where SRUs are not normally available, but where the

packs could be easily picked up during a SAR operation. If this is not possible, arrangements 
should be made to ensure rapid delivery from a nearby depot.
(b) Used stocks of packing material and supplies and survival equipment should be replenished 
immediately. Unused stocks should be inspected and repacked at regular intervals and replaced 
if necessary.
6.4.5 For air SAR facilities:
(a) All fixed-wing search aircraft should carry supplies and survival equipment for dropping to

survivors as soon as they have been found. This will be important when survivors are found 
to be in a weakened condition, or, after being located, must sustain themselves for extended 
periods.
(b) Liferafts packed for dropping should be available for use when:
 – survival craft have not been launched successfully or have been damaged in launching;
 – survival craft have become unserviceable;
 – survivors are overcrowded in the survival craft in use; or
 – survivors are in the water.

– survivors are in the water.
 Liferafts, supplies, and equipment may be dropped together in a chain (ideally with liferafts at 
each end).
(c) An airborne droppable lifeboat may contribute to the rescue, but the need for a particular type 
of aircraft, handling, and dropping procedures makes it an item which can only be used by 
specialized SRUs.
6.4.6 For maritime SAR facilities:
(a) The supplies and survival equipment carried on rescue boats and other inshore craft need not

be extensive when medical attention, blankets, clothing, hot drinks, etc., are available ashore. 
Additional equipment should be taken if the rescue boats are limited in number or the climate 
is severe. Hot liquids, covering for survivors, and insulating blankets for hypothermic survivors 
should always be carried.
(b) Rescue vessels likely to operate some distance offshore should carry an adequate quantity of

the items referred to above, including equipment for artificial respiration, first aid, and advanced 
life support to the extent of the crew’s training.
6.5 Supply dropping
6.5.1 When deciding whether or not supplies should be dropped, consider whether communications have 
been established with the survivors, and if so, whether:
 – the needed supplies have been identified;
 – suitable aircraft are available; and
 – the crew has adequate training and experience.

– the crew has adequate training and experience.
6.5.2 Pilot and crew should understand and be able to account for factors that affect an air drop, such as:
 – correct release point;
 – drift effect of the wind;
 – aircraft speed;
 – aircraft height;
 – relative locations of the distress site and the rescue facility’s base;
 – time before rescue can be effected; and
 – danger of exposure.

– danger of exposure.
6.5.3 Type of aircraft. Military aircraft designed for dropping containers or specially designed civil aircraft 
should be used when supplies are to be dropped. If such aircraft are not available, supplies should 
be dropped only in extreme emergencies. Selection of other aircraft should be made in advance by 
personnel knowledgeable in this type of operation, and accounted for in the plans of operation.

6.5.4 When necessary, a supply-dropping operation should be coordinated with the appropriate ATS unit 
as far in advance of the mission as possible to avoid any undue delay in the issuance of an air traffic 
control clearance.
6.6 Medical personnel
6.6.1 In formulating any rescue plan, the SMC should consider establishing a forward medical base to 
enable triage by competent medical staff. Once the search object has been sighted, the SMC must

consider whether to send medical personnel to the scene. Another consideration is the mental 
trauma that both survivors and rescuers may endure. Plans and procedures should be developed for 
post-traumatic stress syndrome debriefings.
6.7 Rescue by aircraft
6.7.1 In some cases aircraft may be used for rescue. Each aircraft has operational and technical limitations 
and should not be used on operations for which it is not suitable. When possible, a rescue operation

by aircraft should be backed up by a surface facility, particularly for a large number of survivors.
6.7. 2 Fixed-wing aircraft may drop equipment to survivors and direct rescue facilities. They can mark the 
position as long as they can remain on scene, by serving as a radio and radar beacon, showing lights, 
dropping flares, and providing radio signals for direction finding and homing by other rescue facilities.

6.7. 3 The use of a landplane as a rescue aircraft is limited to instances where there is a suitable landing site 
at or near the distress scene or where the aircraft is designed to operate from rough and improvised 
strips. This can be done, for instance, in cold climates where landplanes fitted with skis operate from 
frozen lakes and rivers or snow-covered surfaces. Landing in unknown terrain may, even under ideal

conditions, be hazardous, and the urgency of the situation should be carefully considered by the pilot 
before it is attempted. It may be possible to have one qualified person parachuted in to survey the area.
6.7.4 Seaplanes and amphibians are able to operate from lakes, rivers, and inshore waters and can land 
close to survivors located in such areas. However, a landing in unknown waters may be risky.
(a) Under favourable weather and sea conditions, seaplanes and amphibians can be used for

rescue operations in inland seas, large lakes, bays, or coastal waters. This should only be 
considered when no other means of rescue are immediately available.
(b) Open-sea landings should only be contemplated with aircraft designed for the purpose. A landing 
in the open sea should not be attempted when rescue can be assured through other means.
6.7. 5 Helicopters can be used to rescue survivors by winching or by landing on a ship if a suitable location

exists and the vessel is in a suitable condition. Water landings are possible when amphibious 
helicopters are used. Helicopters which are unable to perform a rescue may be used to drop supplies 
to survivors to sustain life until rescue can be effected. Inability to rescue may be due to a helicopter 
not having a rescue capability, on-scene conditions, or a situation where the number of survivors

exceeds the helicopter’s immediate rescue capacity. Due to their unique capabilities, helicopters 
should be considered for use for specialist rescue tasks. They are particularly suitable for rescues in 
heavy seas, at locations where surface facilities are unable to operate, or for the rescue of individuals

heavy seas, at locations where surface facilities are unable to operate, or for the rescue of individuals

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
such as the severely injured or infirm whose presence is complicating a wider rescue operation. 
However, there are special concerns of which the SMC must be aware:
(a) Operations by surface parties may be hampered by the noise and rotor wash produced by 
helicopters. To facilitate the coordination between helicopters and surface rescue facilities and

to minimize the risk of collision associated with helicopters operating in a confined space, their 
operations should be coordinated by a facility in communication with them, and preferably by 
the OSC.
(b) The number of survivors that a helicopter may take aboard each trip is limited. Therefore, it 
may be necessary to reduce its weight by removal of non-essential equipment or fuel. Fuel 
loads at the scene may be reduced by use of advance bases with fuelling capabilities.

(c) The route followed by the helicopter as well as the location where the survivors are to disembark 
should be known to the SMC.
(d) Due to the generally limited fuel reserves of helicopters, and their susceptibility to icing in some 
locations, it may be advantageous to dispatch a fixed-wing aircraft in advance to confirm the 
suitability of en-route weather, and ensure that the craft requiring assistance is properly briefed 
in advance on helicopter hoisting procedures.

in advance on helicopter hoisting procedures.
(e) Recovery by landing of the helicopter creates additional concerns. Factors like turbulence, 
level terrain, clearing, loose debris, altitude, and landing and take-off paths must be considered 
when selecting a landing site. Operations in a high-altitude environment will reduce helicopter 
performance and severely affect hovering capability. When conditions are marginal, landings 
should be carried out only as a last resort.

should be carried out only as a last resort.
(f) A typical recovery is carried out by hovering over the survivors and taking them aboard using 
a winch with a sling, rescue basket, rescue net, rescue seat, or rescue stretcher. Selection of 
the site is the same as for recovery by landing. However, the cable and rescue device being 
lowered may have a large static electricity charge. No one should touch the cable or rescue 
device until it has made contact with the surroundings.

6.8 Rescue by maritime facilities
6.8.1 When both maritime rescue facilities and helicopters are dispatched to the scene, it may be advisable 
to transfer survivors to the helicopters for a more rapid delivery to medical facilities. All surface SRUs 
should be equipped to lift survivors from the water without help from the survivors, as they may be 
injured, exhausted, or suffering from hypothermia. Survivors might need to be advised to focus on

keeping themselves alive rather than trying to assist in their rescue since this could improve their 
chances of survival.
6.8.2 When hoisting a person who may be suffering from hypothermia, especially after long-term immersion 
in water and especially when lifting them some distance such as to the deck of a high-sided vessel 
or into a helicopter, they should be lifted horizontally or near-horizontally. Hoisting such persons in

a vertical position may cause loss of consciousness, severe shock or cardiac arrest. A rescue lifting 
system, rescue basket or stretcher should be used or two strops or loops with one under the arms 
and the other under the knees.
6.8.3 Rescue vessel capabilities generally fall into two categories.
(a) Designated SRUs can provide excellent means for rescuing survivors in coastal areas and at sea.

Larger vessels are generally capable of radio communication with any ship or craft on all maritime 
frequencies. The master of a designated SRU of this type is particularly suitable for acting as an 
OSC. Larger rescue facilities are capable of all SAR operations, including extended search.
(b) If no designated vessels are available, a merchant ship should take over the duties of OSC (see 
the IAMSAR Manual, volume III, Mobile Facilities). Merchant ships may be the only means for

an immediate rescue. ARCCs and MRCCs responsible for maritime areas should be able to 
rapidly obtain the positions of merchant ships within their areas. Section 1.3 provides additional 
information. (Regarding recovery techniques, IMO provides more information in its Pocket 
Guide to Recovery Techniques.)
6.8.4 Rescue boats typically are designated SRUs but may include any craft near the scene of the distress.

Designated rescue boats are generally small and may not be able to carry many survivors. It may 
be necessary to send a number of boats to the distress scene if they are available. Each boat should 
carry additional life-saving appliances to enable survivors who cannot be rescued immediately to 
remain afloat while awaiting the arrival of another boat.
6.8.5 An aircraft ditching must be responded to immediately since an aircraft will float for only a very 
limited time.

limited time.
6.9  Rescue by land facilities
6.9.1 Land facilities can be used to rescue survivors of aircraft crashes inland and also maritime survivors 
who may be trapped on shorelines or in estuaries where rescue by sea or air is not possible. Although 
the location of the distress scene is known, it may be difficult for a land facility to reach it. Therefore, 
the operation should not be undertaken without sufficient planning.

6.9.2 The land facility should be taken to a location as near as possible to the distress scene by some 
means of rapid transport. If access to the site is difficult, an aerial survey of the area can help to 
determine the best route. The equipment carried should be carefully selected and arrangements 
made for containers to be dropped, should further supplies and equipment be required. A land 
facility should be equipped with a suitable portable two-way radio.

6.9.3 As soon as the distress scene is located, an attempt should be made to account for all occupants of 
the distressed craft. The search must continue until all of the occupants have been found, otherwise 
accounted for, or there is no significant chance of locating additional survivors. Meanwhile, those 
survivors who have been located must be rescued as soon as possible.
6.9.4 The duties of a land facility at a distress scene include:
 – giving first aid;

– giving first aid;
 – evacuating survivors by whatever means are available;
 – collecting and preserving medical and technical data to support investigations;
 – establishing identities of casualties/survivors;
 – making a preliminary examination of the wreckage; and
 – reporting to the SMC.
6.10 Use of pararescue teams
6.10.1 A pararescue team becomes a land facility as soon as it has landed.

6.10.2 A pararescue team usually consists of two parachutists with emergency medical care kits, survival 
kits, and a scuba or forest-penetration parachute kit. They should be trained in parachuting and, 
ideally, in such skills as mountaineering, survival in all environments, advanced emergency medical 
care, and scuba diving. They should be able to deploy from aircraft over any type of terrain or water,

day or night, to assist survivors. Jumps into isolated areas should, if possible, be made by more than 
one team simultaneously.
6.10.3 When considering the use of pararescue teams to reach an accident site, the team leader or a 
designated representative must be involved during the planning stages to ensure that any decision 
to employ parachutists is made only after due consideration of all factors. A pararescue team may

prove to be the only or best means to ascertain that there are survivors. It may be desirable that a 
team be carried by each SAR aircraft that is suitable for dropping parachutists.
6.10.4 Precautionary measures should include:
 – jumps made only from aircraft approved for this type of operation;
 – precautions similar to those taken for supply-dropping operations (see paragraph 6.5); and
 – pilots experienced in parachute-jumping operations.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 6-7
6.8.4 Rescue boats typically are designated SRUs but may include any craft near the scene of the distress. 
Designated rescue boats are generally small and may not be able to carry many survivors. It may 
be necessary to send a number of boats to the distress scene if they are available. Each boat should 
carry additional life-saving appliances to enable survivors who cannot be rescued immediately to

remain afloat while awaiting the arrival of another boat.
6.8.5 An aircraft ditching must be responded to immediately since an aircraft will float for only a very 
limited time.
6.9  Rescue by land facilities
6.9.1 Land facilities can be used to rescue survivors of aircraft crashes inland and also maritime survivors 
who may be trapped on shorelines or in estuaries where rescue by sea or air is not possible. Although

the location of the distress scene is known, it may be difficult for a land facility to reach it. Therefore, 
the operation should not be undertaken without sufficient planning.
6.9.2 The land facility should be taken to a location as near as possible to the distress scene by some 
means of rapid transport. If access to the site is difficult, an aerial survey of the area can help to 
determine the best route. The equipment carried should be carefully selected and arrangements

made for containers to be dropped, should further supplies and equipment be required. A land 
facility should be equipped with a suitable portable two-way radio.
6.9.3 As soon as the distress scene is located, an attempt should be made to account for all occupants of 
the distressed craft. The search must continue until all of the occupants have been found, otherwise 
accounted for, or there is no significant chance of locating additional survivors. Meanwhile, those

survivors who have been located must be rescued as soon as possible.
6.9.4 The duties of a land facility at a distress scene include:
 – giving first aid;
 – evacuating survivors by whatever means are available;
 – collecting and preserving medical and technical data to support investigations;
 – establishing identities of casualties/survivors;
 – making a preliminary examination of the wreckage; and
 – reporting to the SMC.
6.10 Use of pararescue teams

6.10 Use of pararescue teams
6.10.1 A pararescue team becomes a land facility as soon as it has landed.
6.10.2 A pararescue team usually consists of two parachutists with emergency medical care kits, survival 
kits, and a scuba or forest-penetration parachute kit. They should be trained in parachuting and, 
ideally, in such skills as mountaineering, survival in all environments, advanced emergency medical

care, and scuba diving. They should be able to deploy from aircraft over any type of terrain or water, 
day or night, to assist survivors. Jumps into isolated areas should, if possible, be made by more than 
one team simultaneously.
6.10.3 When considering the use of pararescue teams to reach an accident site, the team leader or a 
designated representative must be involved during the planning stages to ensure that any decision

to employ parachutists is made only after due consideration of all factors. A pararescue team may 
prove to be the only or best means to ascertain that there are survivors. It may be desirable that a 
team be carried by each SAR aircraft that is suitable for dropping parachutists.
6.10.4 Precautionary measures should include:
 – jumps made only from aircraft approved for this type of operation;
 – precautions similar to those taken for supply-dropping operations (see paragraph 6.5); and

– pilots experienced in parachute-jumping operations.

6.11  Special requirements at aircraft crash sites
6.11.1 Many military aircraft are fitted with ejection seats and other hazardous material, e.g. bombs or 
chemicals. National procedures for such incidents should be available to RCCs. When a pilot has 
to be removed from an aircraft so fitted, extreme care should be taken to avoid triggering the seat

mechanism. The activating handles are normally indicated by red or yellow-and-black colouring.
6.11.2 The aircraft wreckage and its surroundings should not be disturbed except to assist in the recovery of 
survivors. Not only does the wreckage pose dangers, but the position of flight controls, the location 
of debris and other factors are important to the accident investigation. Rescue facilities should be

aware of this policy. Control of access to the crash site should be established as soon as possible.
6.11.3 It is important for the team leader to ensure that the aircraft is not accidentally set on fire. If it 
is necessary to cut into the aircraft to remove survivors, non-sparking tools should be used and 
fire extinguishers should be kept ready. Composite material construction of some aircraft and the

possible presence of hazardous materials pose additional safety hazards to rescue personnel.
6.11.4 To help investigators, photographs should be taken of the crash site and of the wreckage. A description 
should be passed on to the SMC as soon as possible.
6.11.5 Measures to preserve as much medical evidence as possible include:
 – photography of bodies before moving them;
 – shielding of bodies from the elements by the best means available;

– notation of the position of immobilized survivors; and
 – maintenance of a medical log for each survivor.
 Note: Except for compelling reasons, human remains should not be moved without authorization 
from the SMC who should, in turn, obtain authorization from an appropriate authority.
6.12  Ditching assistance
6.12.1 RCC assistance for ditching should include:
 – obtaining the latest position of the aircraft by any means available, e.g. from the aircraft, from

its escort (if applicable), by direction finding, or by radar;
 – requesting the maritime RCC or CRSs to alert vessels in the vicinity of the distressed aircraft, 
asking them to keep a listening watch on frequency 4,125 kHz if possible, or on 3,023 kHz 
otherwise;
 – providing the aircraft with the position of the nearest ship (hence, the importance of ship 
reporting systems to ARCCs), the course to steer, and information on sea condition and ditching 
heading;

heading;
 – requesting the distressed aircraft to communicate with the selected vessel on 4,125 kHz or 
any other suitable frequency (if applicable — if this is not possible, act as a relay station); and
 – if time permits, informing the ship of how it can assist the aircraft.
6.12.2 Assistance provided by ships for ditching depends on the capabilities of the ship. Communications 
between ships and aircraft are discussed in section 2.8. The nearest vessel to the ditching aircraft

will often be a merchant ship. The ship may be limited to the assistance arranged by the RCC, 
but it can also rescue survivors. The most suitable vessels are SRUs equipped for two-way radio 
communications with the aircraft, and with crews trained and equipped for SAR incidents including 
ditching. Assistance from vessels includes:
 – locating the aircraft by radar;
 – providing navigation and homing aids;
 – furnishing weather and sea information;
 – directing the aircraft to the vessel;

– directing the aircraft to the vessel;
 – assisting the aircraft by marking a sea-lane and providing illumination; and
 – effecting rescue after the ditching.
6.12.3 Ditching assistance provided by escort aircraft to distressed aircraft may include:
 – guiding it to the vessel alongside which it plans to ditch;
 – giving advice on ditching procedures;
 – evaluating the sea conditions and recommending a ditching heading;
 – informing the vessel on how it can assist the ditching aircraft;

– dropping survival and emergency equipment;
 – informing the SMC of the location of the ditching;
 – directing other vessels to the scene; and
 – providing illumination for a night ditching if this cannot be done by the vessel or if the ditching 
is taking place away from vessels.
6.13  Rescue of persons from inside damaged, capsized, or ditched craft
6.13.1 The rescue of persons from inside damaged, capsized, or ditched craft is typically dangerous,

and should normally be attempted only with suitable facilities, equipment, and specially trained 
personnel. Such operations are generally carried out in three stages:
 – investigation of the situation;
 – prevention of sinking; and
 – life-saving.
6.13.2 There is always the risk of the craft sinking or shifting. Diving may be required for actions to reduce 
this risk and for the rescue operation; therefore, these operations must be conducted promptly 
according to a prudent plan.

according to a prudent plan.
 Investigation of the Situation
6.13.3 Rescue personnel must conduct an initial investigation and accurately assess the condition of the 
emergency. A reasonable work plan should then be developed based on the investigation.
6.13.4 Items of Investigation. The following items should be investigated.
(a) Distress area considerations:
 – incident position and depth of water at that location;

– meteorological and sea conditions (weather, wind direction and velocity, air temperature, 
sea current direction and velocity, water temperature, visibility both above and below the 
water surface, waves, swells, etc.);
 – existence of fishing nets or other obstructions;
 – leakage of hazardous material;
 – conditions of other vessels in the vicinity; and
 – existence of sharks or other dangerous marine life.
(b) Rescue forces considerations:
 – size and number of boats and aircraft;

– size and number of boats and aircraft;
 – number of divers;

 – furnishing weather and sea information;
 – directing the aircraft to the vessel;
 – assisting the aircraft by marking a sea-lane and providing illumination; and
 – effecting rescue after the ditching.
6.12.3 Ditching assistance provided by escort aircraft to distressed aircraft may include:

 – conditions of other vessels in the vicinity; and
 – existence of sharks or other dangerous marine life.
(b) Rescue forces considerations:
 – size and number of boats and aircraft;
 – number of divers;

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-10 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 – availability of floating cranes, tugboats, fishing boats, etc.;
 – medical assistance; and
 – transport for rescue personnel and survivors.
(c) Missing persons considerations:
 – number of persons missing;
 – position of crew when the accident occurred;
 – existence of survivors inside (determine by tapping or other reaction tests); and

– need for emergency measures to sustain survivors trapped inside (i.e. supply of air into 
the craft, etc.).
(d) Craft structure and stability considerations:
 – craft type, tonnage, and cargo, etc.;
 – condition of craft and its nearby surroundings;
 – amount of the craft exposed above the waterline, and changes;
 – list, pitching, and rolling, and their changes and sequence;
 – air, hazardous materials, and fuel leakage; and
 – lapse of time after capsizing, damage, or ditching.

6.13.5 Investigation procedures. The following investigation procedures should normally be used in various 
situations.
(a) Conditions on scene. While approaching the wreck, rescuers should observe circumstances 
such as meteorological conditions, sea phenomena, conditions of other vessels in the vicinity, 
and so on. They should also check to see if there is any debris in and under the water.
(b) Investigation of craft. The average waterline, list, and leakage of air should be observed at

appropriate intervals with video or instant cameras to quickly verify any change of condition. 
If at least one metre of a floating craft is exposed and the list is insignificant, investigators may 
consider climbing onto the craft to check for air leakage from the doors, stern tube, etc.
(c) Existence of survivors. Investigators may hit the craft with hammers or other items, and then 
listen for any reaction suggesting the existence of survivors. To hear weak signals from the

survivors may require silence among the rescuers. A loudspeaker may be used in an attempt to 
talk to persons inside. Inboard voices may be audible when the ear is put against the outside 
of the craft, thus making it possible to talk with survivors inside. If it is difficult to lower a 
workboat or for investigators to move from a workboat on to the distressed craft due to stormy 
weather or other hazards, investigating divers should arrive from the leeward side of the craft

to reach underneath and hit it with knife grips or similar objects, to see if there is any reaction 
from persons inside. At this point, it is normally premature and too dangerous to actually swim 
beneath or enter the craft.
6.13.6 Other matters to be considered during the investigation are listed below.
(a) When a fishing boat has capsized, there are often fishing nets adrift in the nearby sea area, so 
caution is needed in manoeuvring vessels and carrying out the rescue operation.

(b) The craft may be less likely to sink if the following conditions of the craft exist:
 – floating on an even keel;
 – not listing;
 – existing waterline is one-fifth to one-half the normal draught;
 – no opening in the hull leaks air; or
 – floating for more than one hour in the same condition.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 6-11
(c) Even if there was no reaction when the craft was tapped the first time, it is necessary to tap it 
three or four times at appropriate intervals (i.e. every thirty minutes).
(d) Unless it is known that there are no survivors, work should be performed with the assumption 
that survivors remain inside.
 Prevention of sinking

Prevention of sinking
6.13.7 Measures that could be taken, where practicable, to help prevent the sinking of the craft during 
rescue operations include:
 – preventing air leakage;
 – supplying air into the craft;
 – fitting floats;
 – holding alongside;
 – suspending the hull by a floating crane; or
 – stranding in a shallow place.
6.13.8 Prevention of air leakage. This may be accomplished by:
 – closing openings such as doors, ventilators, hatches, pipe, stern tube, etc.; and

– plugging cracks with wooden or metallic wedges.
6.13.9 Supply of air into the craft. Air may be introduced into the craft from a lower opening, or by using 
special tools, e.g. striking a drive pin through to the inside and attaching an air hose.
6.13.10 Fitting of floats . Attaching floats is effective when it is not practical or safe to supply air to the 
inside. However, floats may not fully compensate for the lost buoyancy of the craft and should

be considered mainly to minimize the leakage of air and prevent sinking by correcting list or trim. 
Typical methods of fitting floats are as follows:
(a) Looping method: a wire or cable is looped around the lower part of the craft and both ends are 
fitted to floats.
(b) Fitting wires to a fixed object: one end of a wire or cable is fitted to a bollard or some other 
fixed object and the other end to a float.
6.13.11 Holding alongside. This can be accomplished by using one or two vessels.

(a) Alongside support by two rescue vessels: two vessels move into position on opposite sides of 
the craft, but at an appropriate distance from it; wires or cables are then stretched under the 
craft between both vessels.
(b) Alongside support by one rescue vessel: a single vessel may be used to limit list or to support 
one end of the craft.
 Note: Wires or cables used to support the craft may be taken off or cut off immediately as the 
situation demands.

situation demands.
6.13.12 Floating crane. This method is most effective in preventing the sinking of a damaged vessel. It is 
necessary to immediately arrange use of a floating crane and tugs.
6.13.13 Stranding in a shallow place . The craft may be gently grounded in nearby shallow water if the 
situation permits, and if it appears safer than the present situation.
6.13.14 Other factors to be considered to prevent sinking are listed below.

(a) Supplying air into a craft provides buoyancy, but the air should be introduced into an area 
where it will improve rather than worsen the craft’s stability.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-12 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(b) Keeping the craft level improves the chances for survivors and helps to prevent sinking.
(c) Maintaining buoyancy with air and correcting list with side support or floats decreases the 
possibility of sinking.
(d) A capsized vessel may turn sideways if more than half of its hull comes out of the water.
(e) Alongside support may lead to the sinking or damage of the craft if manoeuvring is done

incorrectly, especially in stormy weather.
(f) Supplying fresh air to the subdivisions where survivors are located may be necessary.
 Life-saving
6.13.15 Survivors can be expected to be in state of a panic or shock, and in complete darkness. Rapid rescue 
is necessary due to the lack of food, water, and fresh air in a capsized craft.
6.13.16 Survivors may be rescued either through an opening made above the waterline, or from under water.

Select the method that has the greatest chance for success, taking into account that making an opening 
can threaten the air pocket in the vessel and survivors may panic if they have to dive under water.
6.13.17 Measures for prolonging lives. The following measures may be used to help prolong the lives of 
survivors.
(a) Periodic tapping on the craft by rescue personnel may reveal the existence of survivors and

provide encouragement by keeping them informed of the progress of the rescue operation.
(b) Air hoses or air tanks for divers may be used to feed fresh air to the compartments with 
survivors.
(c) If survivors are accessible by divers, fresh water and food can be provided until the survivors 
are rescued.
6.13.18 Rescue operations by diving . The following procedures should be followed when attempting to 
rescue survivors by diving.

rescue survivors by diving.
(a) To reduce the risks associated with entry into capsized, damaged, or ditched craft, ensure that:
 – the craft is afloat evenly at both ends, there are no obvious air leaks, and there is no 
change in the draught for at least 30 minutes;
 – measures for the prevention of foundering, such as side support and fitting of floats, have 
been fully carried out;
 – the craft is sitting on the seabed and there is no danger that it may turn over;

– the portion above the waterline is more than one metre and the vessel is floating in a 
stable manner without air leaks;
 – there are no fishing nets or other debris which may hamper diving;
 – leaking hazardous materials and fuel are avoided;
 – the rolling and pitching of the craft is under control so that diving will not be hampered; 
and
 – no lifting is conducted until the divers return to the surface.
(b) Safety precautions for divers entering the craft include:

– approaching the entrance to an area likely to contain survivors after having discussed the 
situation with knowledgeable people who can identify and locate any potential obstacles;
 – using a liaison person so that divers may be immediately refloated when there appears to 
be a change in the condition of craft;
 – stretching a guide rope from the sea surface to the entrance for use by divers;
 – briefing divers about the entrance and the arrangement of the craft inside, taking measures

to secure inboard objects which may fall, and understanding the retreat signals to be 
used in an emergency; and
 – arranging for divers inside the craft to use ropes, with at least one diver staying at the 
entrance holding one end of the ropes for emergency escape and transmission of signals.
(c) After survivors have been discovered, divers should:
 – set guide ropes which lead from the entrance to the survivors;
 – brief survivors on the rescue operation;

– brief survivors on the rescue operation;
 – equip survivors with breathing apparatus with mask, as appropriate;
 – position divers behind and in front of survivors to act as an escort along the guide rope; 
and
 – ensure that survivors receive immediate medical care.
6.13.19 Rescue operations through openings above the waterline. The following factors should be considered 
during rescues above the surface of the water.
(a) The following precautions should be used:

(a) The following precautions should be used:
 – obtaining drawings of the vessel, e.g. general arrangement, to determine the safest areas 
for cutting;
 – selecting areas to cut that do not threaten the air pocket of the survivors, fuel tanks, or 
other dangerous cargo on board;
 – opening a small, airtight section, so that the craft does not sink if it becomes flooded;
 – making up for lost buoyancy by side support, fitting of floats, and suspension by a floating 
crane;

crane;
 – considering the possibility that gas, sparks, and the like which are generated when the 
craft is opened may set fire to inboard flammables or may hamper survivors;
 – noting the area to be cut and moving the survivors away from the area;
 – protecting against possible burns or eye injuries from sparks; and
 – understanding the method of signalling (tapping, etc.) in an emergency.
(b) Considerations for opening the compartment include:

– using gas cutters, powered cutters, etc., to cut an opening into the craft;
 – spraying water or taking other measures to ensure that sparks from cutting will not spray 
survivors or set fire to inboard flammables;
 – allowing fresh air into the compartment and cooling the opening, as appropriate, before 
removing survivors.
6.13.20 Other matters to be considered include:
(a) Even when the craft is rolling and pitching, the sea under the craft may be calm, and diving may

be conducted in many cases.
(b) Rescue personnel must be wary of falling objects and have a route for emergency exit in mind 
at all times.
(c) Survivors trapped in a small craft may often be rescued without diving equipment.
6.14 Underwater search and rescue
6.14.1 Many different underwater operations occur within SRRs, such as diving operations or the operation 
of military or civilian submarines. When accidents occur, survivors may be either on the surface or

entrapped in a submarine resting on the seabed. Military submarines trapped under the surface may 
use international distress signals or specific military pyrotechnics, dye markers or beacons. In addition, 
submarines may pump out fuel, lubricating oil or release air bubbles to indicate their position.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 6-13
 – briefing divers about the entrance and the arrangement of the craft inside, taking measures 
to secure inboard objects which may fall, and understanding the retreat signals to be 
used in an emergency; and
 – arranging for divers inside the craft to use ropes, with at least one diver staying at the 
entrance holding one end of the ropes for emergency escape and transmission of signals.

(c) After survivors have been discovered, divers should:
 – set guide ropes which lead from the entrance to the survivors;
 – brief survivors on the rescue operation;
 – equip survivors with breathing apparatus with mask, as appropriate;
 – position divers behind and in front of survivors to act as an escort along the guide rope; 
and
 – ensure that survivors receive immediate medical care.

6.13.19 Rescue operations through openings above the waterline. The following factors should be considered 
during rescues above the surface of the water.
(a) The following precautions should be used:
 – obtaining drawings of the vessel, e.g. general arrangement, to determine the safest areas 
for cutting;

be conducted in many cases.
(b) Rescue personnel must be wary of falling objects and have a route for emergency exit in mind 
at all times.

at all times.
(c) Survivors trapped in a small craft may often be rescued without diving equipment.
6.14 Underwater search and rescue
6.14.1 Many different underwater operations occur within SRRs, such as diving operations or the operation 
of military or civilian submarines. When accidents occur, survivors may be either on the surface or 
entrapped in a submarine resting on the seabed. Military submarines trapped under the surface may

use international distress signals or specific military pyrotechnics, dye markers or beacons. In addition, 
submarines may pump out fuel, lubricating oil or release air bubbles to indicate their position.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-14 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
6.14.2 Submarine SAR, (SUBSAR), is a highly specialized and time-critical activity reliant on specific 
capabilities and training. Medical care requirements for survivors of a submarine accident may also 
be specialized.
6.14.3 Military submarine-operating States have developed standard SUBSAR procedures, capabilities

and training, generally under sponsorship of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for the 
recovery and care of submarine accidents. RCCs may request support of these resources should the 
need arise. Relevant information may be obtained from the NATO International Submarine Escape 
and Rescue Liaison Office.
6.14.4 RCCs should be aware if specialized navy or commercial recovery or treatment facilities (such as

the ones with decompression chambers) exist within or near their SRRs and arrange in advance for 
their use at any time on a 24-hour basis. Similarly, RCCs should liaise with the military to determine 
mutual assistance that could be provided in the event of military submarine accidents.
6.14.5 Most SAR personnel are poorly prepared to understand or handle medical problems peculiar 
to underwater activities, such as decompression sickness, air embolism, and nitrogen narcosis.

However, they should be trained to recognize the symptoms and know how to obtain competent 
medical advice. They should also be trained in handling and transporting victims of such problems 
without worsening their situations. If possible to aid in the treatment of the victim, SAR personnel 
should obtain information such as time underwater, depth, time at the surface, time of the onset of 
symptoms, and the symptoms currently being experienced.

6.14.6 Medical advice should be sought before air transport of submarine accident victims.
6.15 Mass rescue operations
 MRO overview
6.15.1 A mass rescue operation (MRO) is characterized by a need for immediate response to large numbers 
of persons in distress such that the capabilities normally available to SAR authorities are inadequate. It 
is therefore necessary to plan to enhance SAR capability in MROs. Three means of doing this are to:

– agree to share SAR facilities regionally and/or internationally;
 – identify additional SAR facilities locally, including shipping in the area; and
 – extend survival time by providing support to persons in distress until they can be rescued.
 Further information on the identification and selection of SAR facilities, and on the provision of 
supporting supplies and survival equipment, is included in appendix G.

6.15.2 MROs will bring together organizations, at sea and on land, who do not usually work together. It is 
vital that these organizations communicate effectively at all stages – before and after an MRO as well 
as during it. Effective communication begins long before any MRO, at the planning stage, and also 
includes post-incident analysis and identification of learning points to improve arrangements and 
processes based on the experience gained.

processes based on the experience gained.
6.15.3 MROs are relatively rare low-probability high-consequence events compared to normal SAR 
operations. But major incidents leading to the need for MROs have not been infrequent on a 
worldwide basis, and can occur anywhere at any time. The nature of such operations may be poorly 
understood due to limited chances to gain experience of such incidents. It is therefore important to

share, and to study, lessons identified in actual MROs and during the planning, training and testing 
phases of MRO preparation. See chapter 9 for further information on the sharing of lessons identified.
6.15.4 Flooding, earthquakes, terrorism, emergencies in the offshore energy industry and accidents 
involving releases of hazardous materials are examples which, because of their scale, may require the

application of the same resources as required for mass maritime or aeronautical rescue operations. 
There are many potential causes of MROs, and the risks should be analysed locally: but the effects 
are more important than the causes for response planning purposes.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 6-15
6.15.5 The sequence of priority in major multi-mission incidents must be life-saving first, generally followed 
by environmental protection, and then protection of property. Moral and legal obligations and public 
and political expectations require preparedness to carry out MROs safely and effectively should 
they become necessary. Since the need for MROs is relatively rare, it is difficult to gain practical

experience to help deal with them. Types of potential MRO scenarios vary, but there are certain 
general principles that can be followed based on lessons of history.
6.15.6 Effective response to such major incidents requires immediate, well-planned and closely coordinated 
large-scale actions and use of resources from multiple organizations. The following are typical MRO 
demands:
 – intense and sustained high priority life-saving efforts may need to be carried out at the same

time and place as major efforts to protect the environment and property;
 – huge amounts of information need to be readily available at the right times and places to 
support the response efforts and meet the needs of emergency responders, the news media, 
the public, and friends and families of the persons in distress, who may number in the hundreds 
or thousands;
 – many means of communication need to be available and interlinked amongst organizations

at various levels to handle this information reliably for the duration of the response (MRO 
communications are discussed in more detail later in this chapter);
 – an increase in the number of competent staff in all key organizations must be made available 
immediately and be sustainable for up to weeks at a time;
 – equipment and logistics demands may increase to unprecedented levels; and
 – successful MROs depend on the advance provision of flexible and all-level contingency

plans. Intense integrated planning and operational efforts must also be carried out in real time 
throughout the rescue efforts.
6.15.7 All involved in the overall multi-agency, multi-jurisdiction, multi-mission and possibly international 
response to major incidents must clearly understand who is in charge, the respective roles of all 
involved, and how to interact with each other. SAR authorities may be responsible for all or part of

the MRO functions, and must be able to coordinate their efforts with other responders under the 
overall direction of another authority within or outside their own agency. It is therefore essential for 
as many potential MRO responders as practicable to plan and train together.
6.15.8 The broader response environment may involve activities such as:
 – hazards mitigation;
 – damage control and salvage operations;
 – pollution control;
 – complex traffic management;

– complex traffic management;
 – large-scale logistics efforts;
 – medical and coroner functions;
 – accident-incident investigation; and
 – intense public and political attention.
6.15.9 MRO plans need to be part of and compatible with overall response plans for major incidents. Plans 
must typically allow for command, control and communications structures that can accommodate 
simultaneous air, sea and land operations.

simultaneous air, sea and land operations.
6.15.10 There may be resistance to paying the high price in terms of time, effort and funding that preparedness 
for major incidents entails, particularly as they are rare events. The levels of cooperation, coordination, 
planning, resources and exercises required for preparedness are challenging and do not happen

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-16 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
without the active commitment of SAR authorities, regulatory authorities, transportation companies, 
sources of military and commercial assistance and others.
6.15.11 The consequences of poor preparations for MROs in terms of loss of life and other adverse results 
may be disastrous. Major incidents may involve hundreds or thousands of persons in distress in

remote and hostile environments. A large passenger ship collision, a downed aircraft, or a terrorist 
incident could, for example, call for the immediate rescue of large numbers of passengers and crew 
in poor environmental conditions, with many of the survivors having little ability to help themselves.
6.15.12 Preparedness to mount an extraordinarily large and rapid response is critical to preventing large-

scale loss of lives. Such preparedness often depends on strong and visionary leadership and unusual 
levels of cooperation at the planning stage.
6.15.13 MRO planning, preparations and exercises are essential since opportunities to handle actual incidents 
involving mass rescues are rare. Therefore the exercising of MRO plans is particularly important.
6.15.14 Appendix C provides guidance on MRO exercise planning. MSC.1/Circ.1183 provides further

guidance on the provision of external support as an aid to incident containment.
6.15.15 The International Maritime Rescue Federation (IMRF) has developed detailed guidance on preparing 
for maritime MROs. This may be downloaded from www.imrfmro.org.
 General guidance for MROs
6.15.16 For a situation involving large numbers of persons in distress, on-scene responsibilities for their 
safety will be shared. Responsibility for the safety of passengers and crew remains with the person

in charge of the craft in distress while that person is still in command. During the rescue/recovery 
operation responsibilities for the safety of passengers and crew are shared by the person in charge 
of the craft in distress and the pilot in command or master of the rescue unit. The commander of 
each rescue unit has responsibility for the safety of survivors while they are on board the rescue unit.

The OSC and ACO have responsibilities relating to the safe coordination of SAR efforts on scene.
6.15.17 Recovery of people from survival craft at sea is a complex and potentially hazardous operation. 
Keeping people aboard a ship in distress may be safer in some circumstances. However, evacuation 
of a ship at sea takes time, especially if the ship is damaged. The ship’s master may have to make 
the difficult decision to order the commencement of an evacuation without knowing whether or not

it is absolutely necessary. The SMC must be ready to support the master’s decision, by providing 
on-board support where necessary and possible, and SAR facilities on scene in case of evacuation.  
IMO provides guidance on the retrieval of people from the water and from survival craft in its Pocket 
Guide to Recovery Techniques and in volume III of this Manual.
6.15.18 In the case of a downed aircraft, each incident is unique in deciding whether people would be safer

on board or should evacuate. Usually, at sea, they should promptly evacuate the aircraft. On land 
this decision will take into account the conditions of the aircraft and the environment, expected time 
to rescue survivors and whether required survivor care can be best provided inside the aircraft.
6.15.19 In an MRO an OSC should normally be designated by the SMC. Where there is a pilot or master

still in command of a craft in distress, the OSC acts in support of this person, bearing in mind that 
the OSC’s primary responsibility is to coordinate SAR facilities and rescue efforts under the SMC’s 
general direction.
6.15.20 Unnecessary communications with the master of a ship or pilot in command of an aircraft in distress 
must be minimized, and this should be taken into account in advance planning. Exchanges of

information by use of SAR Plans of Cooperation for passenger ships and by other agreed means, 
will reduce the need to ask the pilot or master for this information during a crisis. Responders 
requiring  this information should be directed to a source ashore or on the ground that is prepared to 
handle many potential requests; the response teams at the shipping company or the airline involved, 
for example.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 6-17
6.15.21 High priority should be given to tracking and accounting for all persons involved in the operation 
on board the distressed craft, aboard survival craft and elsewhere. Efforts to keep them together 
will help in this regard. Availability of accurate manifests and accounting is critical. Search action 
should be carried out and the scene patrolled as a matter of course, to guard against people being

overlooked.
6.15.22 If possible, survival craft should be recovered or sunk after the people in them have been retrieved, 
to avoid wasting valuable resource in checking empty craft subsequently. However, the potential 
that other survivors may find and need the craft should be considered before they are disposed of.
6.15.23 Naval vessels and passenger ships are often better equipped than other types of vessel for retrieving

survivors: but use of any available ships must be considered. Ship reporting systems for SAR may 
help identify commercial ships available to assist.
6.15.24 If a ship with a large freeboard cannot safely retrieve survivors from the water or survival craft, it may 
be possible to first retrieve them onto small vessels, and then transfer them to progressively larger ones.  
Depending on the circumstances, it may be safer to tow survival craft to shore without removing the

occupants at sea. Consideration should also be given to passing survival equipment and supplies to 
people in distress, to sustain them until they can be rescued.
6.15.25 Helicopter capabilities should be used if available, especially for retrieval of weak or immobile 
survivors. Aircraft may also be used to deliver equipment and supplies to sustain life pending rescue. 
Shipping companies are encouraged to equip their vessels with helicopter landing areas or clearly

marked hoist-winch areas to facilitate direct transfers.
6.15.26 Crew members who may become involved in helicopter hoist operations, including survival craft and 
surface SAR unit crews, should be made familiar with the usual procedures. See “Vessel/helicopter 
operations” in volume III.
6.15.27 To the extent practicable, MROs should be coordinated by an SMC in an RCC, and the SAR element 
should always be so. However, depending on the magnitude, nature and complexity of the incident,

the overall response may be better coordinated by an appropriate operations centre higher within 
the SAR agency or another Government agency so that the SMC can focus on the SAR effort. 
Considerations in this decision include:
 – extensive and complex SAR workload for the RCC staff;
 – extensive support by organizations other than those commonly used for SAR;
 – need for international diplomatic support; and

– need for international diplomatic support; and
 – serious problems in addition to potential loss of lives, such as environmental threats, terrorist 
actions, or national security issues.
 If this approach is intended, it is essential that it is pre-planned, with full involvement of all parties, 
including the RCC staff, to avoid confusion at the time of an incident. The plan may, for example,

provide for the RCC to maintain coordination of the SAR response while the higher operations centre 
handles the wider issues.
6.15.28 The following factors should be considered in MRO planning:
 – use of the Incident Command System (ICS) discussed below, or other effective means of 
coordinating multi-agency, multi-jurisdiction, multi-mission scenarios;
 – identification and analysis of situations within the SRR that could potentially lead to the need 
for MROs;

for MROs;
 – mobilization and coordination of necessary SAR facilities, including those not normally used 
for SAR services: see appendix G for further information;
 – ability to activate plans immediately;
 – call-up procedures for needed personnel;
 – need for supplemental communications capabilities, possibly including the need for interpreters;

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-18 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 – use of liaison officers;
 – activation of additional staff to augment, replace or sustain needed staffing levels;
 – need for supplemental information technology and telecommunications facilities, in case of 
overload;
 – best use of the air and surface SAR facilities available;
 – recovery and transport of large numbers of survivors (including those unfit, injured or incapable);

– triage classification tools such as numbered and/or coloured cards or tags (see section 6.17);
 – identification of potential landing sites;
 – identification of potential places of safety (survivor reception centres);
 – providing for survivors’ needs, including medical needs, during the transfer to places of safety, 
guarding against hypothermia etc.;
 – recovery and handling of bodies;
 – a means of reliably accounting for everyone involved, including responders;

– efficient and smooth handover from SAR facilities to shore/land response units at landing points/
places of safety;
 – care, assistance and further transfer of survivors once delivered to a place of safety and further 
transfer of bodies beyond their initial delivery point;
 – activation of plans for notifying, managing and assisting the families and friends of those 
involved;
 – activation of plans for working with the news and social media;

– control of access to the RCC and other sensitive facilities and locations;
 – RCC backup and relocation plans, as appropriate; and
 – ready availability to all potential users of plans, checklists, flowcharts, etc.
6.15.29 The ability of an RCC to continue to effectively coordinate the MRO and still handle its other SAR 
responsibilities may become overwhelmed, and another RCC/RSC or other authority may need to 
assist.

assist.
6.15.30 With these possibilities in mind, MRO plans should provide for various degrees of response, along 
with criteria for determining which degree of response will be implemented. For example, as local 
SAR resources are exhausted, SAR resources may need to be obtained from distant national or 
international sources. These resources will need to be alerted at the outset, and may need to move 
forward so as to be ready when required.

forward so as to be ready when required.
6.15.31 Experiences in responding to major incidents have resulted in the following practical guidance. 
Authorities should:
 – plan how any agency receiving notification of an actual or potential mass rescue event can 
immediately alert the RCC, the responsible lead SAR agency and other authorities that will 
potentially be involved, brief them, and enable immediate actions to be taken by all concerned

(this will require identification of entities in each agency that can be contacted on a 24-hour 
basis, and that have authority to immediately initiate actions and commit resources);
 – train all staff who will be involved; 
 – conduct exercises to test both the plans and the training;
 – coordinate all search and rescue operations effectively from the very beginning;
 – begin quickly with a high level of effort and stand down as appropriate rather  than begin too

late or with too little effort;
 – ensure that MRO emergency plans address communications needs and interoperability;
 – be prepared to use an Incident Command System (ICS) or equivalent when appropriate;

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 6-19
 – ensure that air traffic, air space and sea or land traffic can be and is controlled on and around 
the scene;
 – assign additional liaison personnel on scene, as required;
 – anticipate incident development and needs and act early;
 – ensure that the scope of SAR plans and other emergency or disaster response plans, including

company emergency response plans, are coordinated to reduce gaps, overlaps and confusion 
about the person in overall charge and the command, coordination and communication 
structures, and the procedures to be followed at various times and places;
 – determine in advance how private resources can be appropriately used to supplement other 
SAR resources;
 – use capable resources like passenger ships for taking large numbers of survivors on board;

– control access to the scene, including access by the news media;
 – retrieve and protect debris as evidence for follow-on investigation;
 – put security plans in place to limit access to the RCC;
 – arrange in advance to involve the Red Cross/Red Crescent, critical incident stress experts and 
other such support for human needs;
 – identify senior agency spokespersons to protect the time of workers directly involved in the

response and designate a senior official to provide information to families;
 – clearly identify the point at which the SAR response (life-saving) has ended and the focus shifts 
to investigation and recovery, noting that these may be parallel processes during a response;
 – ensure that SAR plans provide for logistics and welfare support for large numbers of rescuers 
and survivors including pre-arranged accommodations, if possible, and availability of food, 
medical care and transportation;

medical care and transportation;
 – consider requesting assistance from airlines and shipping companies other than the one 
whose aircraft or ship is involved in the incident, and know the types of assistance that such 
organizations might provide;
 – attempt to reduce the burden on the distressed craft’s pilot or master and crews; in maritime 
cases, if safe and appropriate to do so, place a marine casualty officer on board to assist the 
master and SAR personnel; and

master and SAR personnel; and
 – share capabilities, expertise and assets among Government and industry to take maximum 
advantage of the strengths of each.
 Communications planning for mass rescue operations
6.15.32 Communication plans must provide for a heavy volume of communication use as a major incident 
will normally involve many responding organizations that need to communicate effectively with

each other from the beginning. It is likely that the volume of communications at the beginning of 
an MRO will be very high and potentially confused. This must be prepared for and managed until 
the situation becomes more stable. Advance arrangements should be made as necessary to link 
communications systems that are not inherently interoperable. Interagency communications must be 
based on terminology understood by all involved.

based on terminology understood by all involved.
6.15.33 Efficient MRO responses depend upon efficient communication, and efficient communication 
requires planning, understanding of the plan by those who will have to put it into effect and its 
rapid implementation at the time of the incident. The following are some of the factors MRO 
communications planners are recommended to consider:
 – Who is likely to be involved in the response to a MRO, including supporting organizations and

others with legitimate interest (e.g. officials, family members of victims, the news media, etc.)?
 – What are their information needs likely to be?
 – Where do they fit in the overall command, control and coordination (and, therefore, 
communications) structure?

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-20 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 – What are the information priorities?
 – What communications facilities do the responders have?
 – Are there enough people to operate the communications systems, over a potentially long 
period? The planning should include provision for relief personnel.
 – How should these facilities best be used to avoid overload? How should a large amount of data 
(such as search plans or passenger lists) be communicated?

– Do people know what to say and who to talk to? Do they understand their unit’s place in the 
communications network, other units’ roles, and the overall information priorities? Are they 
aware of the importance of clear procedures and communications discipline?
 – Are there likely to be language difficulties, including potential misunderstanding of technical 
language?
 – Who will control and keep order on the various parts of the communications network and do

they understand this particularly important role?
 – To what extent are different responders’ communications systems and procedures 
interoperable? Can communications hubs be established or liaison officers exchanged to help 
explain priorities, procedures and technical language?
 – Can common communications devices be provided to responding units to enable direct 
communications between them?
 – How long might the incident last? Distress frequencies may be used for the initial response but

the plan should ensure that these frequencies are cleared as soon as practicable.
 – What will the social media impact be, and how can it be addressed?
 Appendix C outlines a basic MRO communications plan structure.
 Major incident coordination
6.15.34 Regardless of the magnitude and priority of the life-saving efforts involved in responding to a major 
incident, if any other functions are being carried out concurrently on scene by other than SAR

personnel, the overall response involving SAR and the other functions, e.g. fire fighting, must be 
well coordinated. If basic concepts and terms are recognized and understood by all emergency 
responders, they will be much better prepared to coordinate joint efforts.
6.15.35 Standard SAR procedures should typically be followed for the SAR part of the response, but these 
procedures will be largely independent of other efforts. Companies or authorities handling other

aspects of the response will follow command, control and communication procedures developed 
for their respective organizations and duties. The SAR system can function in its normal manner or 
use modified SAR procedures established to account for the special demands of mass rescues, but 
it should be appropriately linked and subjected to a scheme for management of the overall incident 
response.

response.
6.15.36 For major incidents, crisis management for the overall response may also be needed. The Incident 
Command System (ICS) is one simple and effective means of meeting this need. ICS can be used 
where no equivalent means of overall incident management is in place. SAR and transportation 
authorities are likely to encounter use of the ICS within emergency response communities. The 
ICS works best with some advance familiarization and exercising. Appendix C provides general

information.
 Landing sites
6.15.37 Ideally, a single landing site will be established for the mass rescue incident. A single site enables all 
land support resources to be consolidated at one location. This reduces overhead requirements and 
facilitates response management. Multiple sites require more people and material – both of which 
are often in short supply during a crisis.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 6-21
6.15.38 However, some mass rescue operations may require multiple landing sites due to geographic 
location and range, number of evacuees, landing site size or arrangement, rescue vessel or aircraft 
limitations, or other reasons. Each site must be established and managed to meet the functions 
expected. Considerations include:
 – Proximity to incident location.

– Proximity to incident location.
 – Proximity to land support facilities; for example, hospitals and suitable reception centres.
 – Land facilities’ survivor support capacity.
 – Waterside access for rescue vessels.
 – Safe landing areas for aircraft.
 – Aircraft refuelling facilities, especially for helicopters.
 – Sufficient aircraft apron parking space.
 – Ease of transfer from rescue craft to land.
 – Land transportation access.
 – Crowd control and foot traffic flow.

– Crowd control and foot traffic flow.
 – Disabled and other special needs requirements.
 – Sufficient space for assembly of survivors.
 – Adequate space for medical and other support services.
 – Sheltering capability.
 – Site control and security capability.
 – Secure location for retrieved debris for investigation purposes.
 Industry planning and response
6.15.39 SAR authorities should coordinate MRO plans with companies that operate ships and aircraft designed

to carry large numbers of persons. Such companies should share in preparations to minimize the 
chances that MROs will be needed, and to ensure success if they become necessary.
6.15.40 Appendix C provides guidance on industry roles and discusses how companies could arrange for 
use of field teams and emergency response centres as possible means of carrying out their MRO 
responsibilities.

responsibilities.
6.15.41 For passenger ships, SAR Plans for Cooperation required by the Safety of Life at Sea Convention and 
developed by SAR authorities and shipping companies are part of the MRO process and a useful 
tool in the early stages of the response to an incident involving a passenger ship, either as casualty 
or a SAR facility. 
 Public and media relations for MROs
6.15.42 Good public and media relations, including on social media, are very important but also very

demanding during MROs. Airlines and/or passenger shipping companies involved will be working 
intensively with the news media, and may be making use of social media. SAR authorities should 
collaborate with them on the flow of information. The role of the media may be critical in shaping 
the reactions of the public and of those directly involved in the distress situation in a way that 
contributes to safety, control and success. There should be no unwarranted delays in providing 
information.

information.
6.15.43 Information should be readily available, clear, accurate, consistent and freely exchanged among 
emergency responders and others concerned. Many entities may be involved in the response to a 
major incident, including ships, aircraft, companies and SAR services. Coordination is required to

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-22 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
ensure that there is one message with many messengers. Develop press releases and social media 
responses, and appoint trained spokespeople.  Do not speculate, but do work with the news media 
to ensure that factual information is conveyed in an appropriate and timely manner. Interviews 
should be live if possible.

should be live if possible.
6.15.44 Appointing well-informed spokespeople not directly involved in the incident otherwise can be 
valuable in relieving the key response staff of this duty.
6.15.45 The media is a rapid-response, 24-hour global market, and its news is broadcast worldwide. The 
media will find a way to get to the scene for first hand information, pictures and video. By providing 
transportation to the scene and controlling media access, safety and the information the media

reports can be better managed.
6.15.46 Prompt establishment of a joint information centre at a location distant from the SMC will help to 
achieve the goal of controlled public relations. (A joint information centre is a component of an 
ICS and is discussed in appendix C). The centre can establish proper procedures for the release of 
messages to the public. Since the messages may be sensitive, it is critical that everyone communicates

the same information. The centre can be responsible for coordinating information made available 
via the internet and perhaps establishing and maintaining a public website and regular social media 
updates dedicated to the emergency response.
6.15.47 Information should be provided to the public on the SAR facilities being used and, if possible, a 
web address and/or contact phone numbers should be provided for families, media and others to

contact for more information. Preparations should be made so that large numbers of callers can be 
accommodated without saturating the phone system or crashing the computer server.
6.15.48 Advance preparation of standby web pages by transportation companies and SAR authorities can 
help in responding to floods of requests for information. These pages can be quickly posted to 
provide general information for media and general public. Web information (including information

posted on social media) should be timely and accurate.
6.15.49 Once posted, these pages can be easily updated with the status of the incident and could also include:
 – contact information;
 – basic Government, SAR service and/or industry facts;
 – industry and SAR definitions;
 – photographs and statistics of aircraft, ships and other SAR facilities;
 – answers to frequently asked questions;
 – links to other key websites;
 – background information on the craft in distress, if available; and

– library footage.
 MRO follow-up actions
6.15.50 Careful accounting for survivors after they have been delivered to a place of safety remains important. 
They need to be kept informed about plans for them and about the ongoing response operations. 
With large numbers of persons often in different places, keeping track of and working with them can 
be difficult. If the incident has involved a passenger ship or aircraft it is important to work closely

with the company involved as they may be able to provide considerable assistance. The company is 
usually best suited to assist survivors during this time. Survivors should be protected from harassment 
by the news media or the general public.
6.15.51 Communicating with survivors is more difficult in remote areas where phone service may be 
inadequate or lacking. Communications systems will need to be supplied. In more populated areas,

local agencies may have an emergency evacuation plan or other useful plan that can be implemented 
in support.
6.15.52 It is very important to share lessons identified in actual MRO operations and exercises. Concerns 
about legal liability may discourage staff from highlighting matters that could have been improved but 
sharing experience can help prevent serious mistakes recurring, or can otherwise improve response

in the future. Agreement should be reached among principal participants on how lessons identified 
can be depersonalized and made widely available. Lessons from MROs should be shared not just 
locally, but internationally. See chapter 9 for more information.
6.16 Search and rescue within areas remote from SAR facilities
6.16.1 A key to success when responding to a SAR mission in areas remote from SAR facilities is to develop

a SAR Response Plan which presents agreed procedures in its area of responsibility. This plan relies 
on assets available in the area. The SAR plan should also describe if there are seasonal variations to 
consider so as to identify the basis of the response endeavour.
6.16.2 Within the areas remote from SAR facilities, the SAR authority should describe the availability of 
suitable infrastructure and facilities, capable of supporting a SAR response (e.g. airports/bases, sea

ports, fuel facilities, landing locations, places of safety).
6.16.3 SAR routines and SAR planning should be proactively prepared by the responsible RCC for efficient 
SAR operations in areas remote from SAR facilities.
6.16.4 It is important that RCCs should be aware of the SAR resources available in regional and neighbouring 
RCCs, and arrange regular exchange and update of such information including details about SRUs

(aircraft, vessels, land and specialized units), airstrips, refuelling and other facilities.
6.16.5 If a passenger ship intends to operate in an area remote from SAR facilities, the RCC responsible for 
that area should establish a relationship with the Company and any other organizations involved in 
planning an emergency response in addition to obtaining the basic SAR cooperation plan, to assist 
in case of an emergency. The responsible RCC should also encourage the Company to provide

information regarding the ship’s position and intentions while the ship is operating in the area.
6.16.6 All operators working in areas remote from SAR facilities should be encouraged to advise the 
responsible RCC of the location(s) of their operations and their capabilities to assist in case of an 
emergency.
6.16.7 RCCs in adjacent States should conduct SAREXs with each other with regard to areas remote from

SAR facilities. Such SAREXs need not be complex but simple dialogues and coordination exercises 
to foster an understanding of how each RCC may help the other, including operations across 
SRR boundaries or lines of delimitation. It is important that information is exchanged between 
neighbouring States’ RCCs about SAR data formats and interpretation of such data, for example drift 
modelling outputs and any other computer applications that may assist each other.

6.16.8 The RCC should support the ACO, OSC and other rescue personnel in assessing risks, identifying 
hazards and response options, and other relevant factors of importance when participating in SAR 
missions in areas remote from SAR facilities.
6.16.9 The SMC should take into consideration in SAR missions within areas remote from SAR facilities the 
limitations of communications due to lack of infrastructure, weather conditions, long distances and

topography. Problems may occur in communications between SAR units involved in conducting such 
a SAR mission need to be considered. The SMC should also take into consideration every possible 
means of communication between units through an ACO/OSC or Air Traffic Service Unit, etc.
6.16.10 The SMC should be aware of the need for communication between States, especially if the SAR 
mission is conducted near a SRR boundary and/or the craft in distress is of different nationality.

6.16.11 Factors to consider when establishing the SAR response plan for areas remote from SAR facilities:
1. the number of people potentially at risk as the result of an incident in the area;

means of communication between units through an ACO/OSC or Air Traffic Service Unit, etc.
6.16.10 The SMC should be aware of the need for communication between States, especially if the SAR 
mission is conducted near a SRR boundary and/or the craft in distress is of different nationality.
6.16.11 Factors to consider when establishing the SAR response plan for areas remote from SAR facilities:

1. the number of people potentially at risk as the result of an incident in the area;

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-24 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
2. the total recovery capacity of SAR facilities available to reach the scene of the incident and 
recover those at risk within survival times;
3. the nature of the risk and whether containment strategies can mitigate its effects to enable 
those at risk to survive until rescued;
4. the availability of SAR facilities and other resources which may be deployed in order to contain

the incident and assist those at risk until rescued;
5. the distance (in time) between individual SAR facilities’ starting points and the scene of the 
incident;
6. the terrain, weather and sea conditions;
7. any restrictions on SAR facility deployment and their ability to respond even if theoretically 
within reach of the scene of the incident;
8. the survival time in the prevailing terrain and/or weather and sea conditions;

9. the capability of available SAR facilities to rescue those at risk in the prevailing terrain and/or 
likely weather and sea conditions;
10. availability and quality of communications; and
11. the ability of tasked SAR facilities to provide mutual SAR response assistance if an emergency 
occurs to a deployed SAR facility.
6.17 Care of survivors
6.17.1 After rescue, survivors may require hospital treatment. This must be provided as quickly as possible.

The SMC should consider having ambulance and hospital facilities ready.
6.17. 2 Where there are survivors with different medical needs, and in mass rescue operations, a triage 
system should be used. Triage is the sorting and classification of casualties to determine the order of 
priority for treatment and transportation. There are many different triage systems already in use. For 
example, casualties are often classified into four categories, as follows: 
 Priority I:  Immediate care

Priority I:  Immediate care 
 Priority II: Delayed care 
 Priority III: Minor care 
 Priority IV: Deceased 
6.17. 3 Triage of casualties should include the use of casualty identification tags or cards to aid especially 
in the sorting of the injured and their transportation to medical facilities. Casualty identification tags 
should be standardized through priority numbering and colour coding to make them suitable in 
multilingual situations. The following coding is widely used:

Priority I / immediate: a RED tag or card, with Roman numeral I 
 Priority II / delayed: a YELLOW tag or card, with Roman numeral II 
 Priority III / minor: a GREEN tag or card, with Roman numeral III 
 Priority IV / deceased: a BLACK tag or card, with Roman numeral IV 
6.17.4 Tags or cards should be usable under adverse weather conditions, and be water resistant. Coloured 
light sticks or reflectors are also useful. A card can be used to supply basic information about the

casualty, if time permits: identification details, injuries observed, treatment given, etc. If tags or cards 
are not available, prioritization can be indicated by marking the appropriate Roman numeral on 
adhesive tape, the casualty’s clothing or exposed skin.
6.17. 5 SAR personnel must ensure that, after rescue, survivors are not left alone, particularly if injured or 
showing signs of hypothermia or of physical or mental exhaustion.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 6-25
6.17.6 When selecting the method of transport of survivors to medical facilities, the following factors should 
be considered:
 – condition of survivors;
 – capability of the rescue facility to reach the survivors in the shortest possible time;
 – medical training, qualifications, and operational capabilities of the personnel;

– rescue facilities’ capabilities to transport survivors without aggravating injuries or producing 
new complications;
 – difficulties that may be encountered by land parties (e.g. provision of shelter, food, and water; 
weather conditions, etc.);
 – the possible availability of doctors among the survivors, aboard nearby ships, etc.; and
 – methods of maintaining communication with the SMC.

6.17.7 When medical advice or assistance is required, the rescue facility should provide the SMC a basic 
medical assessment. Other information may also be necessary in certain cases. If medical evacuations 
are being considered, the benefit of such an evacuation must be weighed against the inherent dangers 
of such operations to both the person needing assistance and to rescue personnel. RCCs should make

arrangements to obtain competent medical advice on a 24-hour basis, and should use, when possible, 
medical advice from personnel familiar with risks peculiar to the environments of the SRR, and with 
the inherent risks involved with medical evacuations. It may be advisable to involve such personnel 
in SAR exercises. Medical information provided by the rescue facility to the SMC includes:
 – name of the SAR facility and its available means of communications;

– position of the SAR facility, destination, estimated time of arrival, course, and speed;
 – names, gender, and age of patients;
 – information concerning respiration, pulse, and temperature, and also blood pressure, if possible;
 – location of pain;
 – nature of illness or injury, including apparent cause and related history;
 – symptoms;
 – type, time, form, and amounts of all medications given;
 – time of last food consumption;
 – ability of patients to eat, drink, walk, or be moved;

– whether the rescue facility has a medical kit, and whether a medical professional is with the 
SAR facility;
 – whether a suitable clear area is available for helicopter hoist operations or landing, or a suitable 
beaching area is available for marine craft; and
 – name and point of contact of off-scene persons who hold further details about the distressed 
craft and its occupants.
6.17.8 Victims of diving accidents may need special consideration. These victims often have compressed-

gas injuries that few on-scene SAR personnel understand or are prepared to handle. SAR personnel 
should be able to recognize the general symptoms of dive-related injuries, be aware of their potential 
severity, and take basic steps to minimize worsening the medical condition. Other divers with the 
victim may be excellent sources of information. The RCC should maintain a list of resources that can 
provide diving medical advice and a list of available recompression chambers.

6.17.9 Divers with decompression sickness or an air embolism require immediate treatment with hyperbaric 
oxygen in a recompression chamber. These dive-related injuries are worsened by reduced 
atmospheric pressure. Aircraft transporting these victims should fly at the lowest safe altitude, which 
may require taking a less direct route.

Chapter 6 – Rescue planning and operations
6-26 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
6.18 Debriefing of survivors
6.18.1 A survivor who has been rescued may be able to give information which will assist the SAR operation. 
SAR personnel should question survivors and communicate any information received to the RCC.
6.18.2 Information which may be available from survivors includes:
 – total number of persons on board the distressed craft, the possibility of other survivors being

unaccounted for, and any indication of their position; and
 – the survivor’s own medical history, in particular, about recurring disease, heart trouble, 
diabetes, infectious diseases, epilepsy, or similar condition from which they may suffer. This 
information should be noted, together with any medical attention given, for future attending 
medical personnel.
6.18.3 The debriefing helps to ensure that all survivors are rescued, to attend to the physical welfare of each

survivor, and to obtain information which may assist and improve SAR services. Proper debriefing 
techniques include:
 – due care to avoid worsening a survivor’s condition by excessive debriefing;
 – careful assessment of the survivor’s statements if the survivor is frightened or excited;
 – use of a calm voice in questioning;
 – avoidance of suggesting the answers when obtaining facts; and
 – explaining that the information requested is important for the success of the SAR operation,

and possibly for future SAR operations.
6.19 Handling of deceased persons
6.19.1 Searching for and recovering bodies should be conducted according to international and national 
laws and regulations, and is not normally considered to be part of SAR operations. However, persons 
in distress may expire either before aid can be rendered to them or after they have been rescued. 
Handling of human remains by SAR personnel may at times be necessary. Proper handling of such

situations may benefit persons affected by the loss of life and improve public relations for the SAR 
agency.
6.19.2 SAR authorities should make prior arrangements with other authorities concerned with removal 
and disposal of human remains (often law-enforcement agencies) to coordinate transfer of the 
remains. Where victims are citizens of other States, it may be necessary to use diplomatic channels 
to coordinate transfer of the remains.

to coordinate transfer of the remains.
6.19.3 Human remains at an aircraft crash site should not be disturbed or removed without authorization 
from the SMC except for compelling reasons. The SMC would obtain authorization from an 
appropriate authority, usually associated with aircraft accident investigations.
6.19.4 Without exposing rescuers to danger, an attempt should be made to identify deceased persons. All

articles removed from or found near each body must be kept separate, preferably in a container 
so labelled that it can be correlated later with the body. All these articles should be handed over 
to the proper authority as soon as possible. Handling of human remains can be traumatic. SAR 
personnel need to be informed on proper procedures to use, and after their involvement, counselled 
as appropriate to help meet emotional needs.

as appropriate to help meet emotional needs.
6.19.5 When human remains are recovered during a SAR operation, or when a death occurs on board a 
SAR facility, a waybill should be made out for each deceased person. It should contain the full name 
and age of the deceased (if known), as well as the place, date, time, and cause of death (if possible). 
This waybill should be made out in the national language of the SAR facility and, wherever possible, 
in English.

in English.
6.19.6 Considerations for the transport of human remains include:
(a) On vessels, body bags or sailcloth for human remains should be carried. If human remains are 
kept on board for any length of time, they should be properly wrapped and put in a suitable 
place on the vessel.
(b) SAR aircraft do not normally transport human remains. However, SAR aircraft may have to 
carry human remains if no other means are readily available.

(c) Immediately after return to a base specified by the RCC, the remains must be handed over to 
the appropriate authorities, accompanied by the waybill.
(d) If it is known or suspected that a deceased person had an infectious disease, all material and 
objects which have been in direct contact with the deceased person must be cleaned and 
disinfected or destroyed.
6.19.7 SAR operations are conducted only for assisting persons who may be living. However, it is wise to

consider the capabilities of existing Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) methods and procedures in 
the instance of a mass casualty accident.
 The DVI operation is a criminal police and forensic science operation carried out according to 
national policies and legislation in accordance with standards established by INTERPOL. As it is not 
legally a part of the SAR operation, it is not coordinated or supervised by the RCCs.

DVI may be of significant assistance to SAR personnel in those instances where unidentified human 
remains are recovered in the course of a SAR case, particularly in those instances of multiple 
casualties. This will assist SAR personnel in accounting for the persons who are the subject of the 
SAR case, and to verify whether or not additional persons remain missing. This will facilitate closing 
the SAR case as expeditiously as possible.

the SAR case as expeditiously as possible.
 SAR and DVI authorities should cooperate in dealing with the families of missing persons. DVI systems 
can usually be accessed through liaison with local or national police agencies. SAR personnel are 
encouraged to assist DVI authorities if that is possible based on other operational commitments and 
organization policies.
6.20 Critical incident stress

6.20 Critical incident stress
6.20.1 Exposure to traumatic events and duties, particularly if they involve dead, mutilated or dismembered 
bodies, is extremely stressful. SAR personnel may need to cope with such situations during or after 
a SAR operation. Adverse psychological effects of working in such an environment increase with 
prolonged exposure, and may be cumulative for personnel involved in multiple events over time.

6.20.2 Aircraft accidents may involve SAR personnel in such operations for a prolonged period, especially if 
the accident occurs at sea where there are few alternative personnel and facilities to handle recovery 
of dead, mutilated or dismembered bodies.
6.20.3 Recovery time for persons so exposed is commonly two to three months, but may last over one 
year and may require professional help a year or more after the event. Even persons experienced in

their profession, and with duties such as body recovery, can experience acute or long-term health 
problems during and after responding to such events. SAR personnel often do not realize how they 
can be affected.
6.20.4 Situations involving death, severe injuries, etc., usually cause SAR personnel to consider the 
vulnerability of themselves and others close to them, and to share the anguish of family members

and others adversely affected by the tragedy. Event anniversaries may trigger adverse responses.

6.20.5 When SAR authorities assign personnel to on-scene duties, transport or other responsibilities 
involving handling or viewing of bodies or body parts, or to similar traumatic duties, they should:
(a) After severe events, arrange separate debriefings or counselling sessions for each category 
of personnel. The demands differ and it is important that the group is small and has an

understanding of the incident from their own professional perspective;
(b) Daily or at each shift change, provide information and advice to crews coming on duty to

traumatic stress;
(f) Limit the number of personnel involved when practicable;
(g) After crews have been debriefed and relieved of duty, arrange to follow up with them and their

families to monitor needs and assist as appropriate; actively follow up for at least one year, 
since symptoms and problems are sometimes delayed;
(h) To aid recuperation after exposure, schedule at least 48 hours away from work responsibilities;
(i) Provide access to trained counselling, chaplains, and other human support services during 
and after the event, and involve spouses or other close persons in follow-up efforts to help the 
person affected recover more easily; and

(j) Arrange for expressions of appreciation by senior personnel, as well as public expressions of 
appreciation, as these can help personnel adapt after facing stressful duties.
6.21 Termination of rescue
6.21.1 As soon as the rescue operation has been completed, the SMC should immediately notify all 
authorities, facilities, or services which have been activated. All information on the conduct of the

rescue operation should be added to that on the search operation and a final report prepared. 
Information of interest to accident investigation and medical authorities should be given to them 
without delay. Chapter 9 provides guidance on conclusion of SAR operations.

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 7-1
Chapter 7
Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
7.1 Overview
7.1.1 The information in this chapter provides guidance for the management and conduct of multiple 
aircraft SAR operations. Any of the described principles and procedures might have to be modified 
by SMCs, ACOs and SRUs, in order to deal with specific situations. Further information on multiple 
aircraft SAR operations is available in IAMSAR Manual, volume III, section 10.

7.1. 2 Flight safety is a primary concern during any mission involving multiple SAR aircraft. SAR aircraft 
should be able to operate effectively and only the aircraft necessary for the mission should be 
involved.
 SAR plans
7.1. 3 Whenever multiple aircraft are involved in a SAR operation, there are additional risks to consider 
and operations should be coordinated. To overcome these risks, SAR authorities should establish

plans for multiple aircraft SAR operations. For reasons of safety and the effectiveness of operations, 
it is important that common procedures are used in SAR plans to ensure the safe flow of aircraft 
during these operations. If possible, these plans should be harmonized between neighbouring SRRs 
(see also IAMSAR Manual, volume I, chapter 6).
7.1.4 SAR authorities are recommended to share their experiences of multiple aircraft SAR operations with

recommendations to improve SAR plans and documents.
 Number of SAR aircraft required
7.1. 5 In any SAR operation, SMCs should consider the capabilities and the number of aircraft required. 
Too few aircraft in an operation might prove fatal for persons in distress, while too many can be 
difficult to organize, increase pilot workload and the risk of collisions. Other factors that might 
affect the number of aircraft required include the number of casualties, the carrying capacity of

participating aircraft, weather conditions on scene, the distance of persons in distress from rescue 
facilities, the number of evacuation points, the speed at which an evacuation can take place, the 
speed of participating aircraft, the availability of refuelling facilities, the duration of an operation, 
aircrew fatigue and other operational factors. Where more aircraft than needed are available some 
can be held in reserve.
 Aircraft capabilities

can be held in reserve.
 Aircraft capabilities
7.1.6 SMCs should consider how to match different aircraft capabilities to the circumstances and tasks 
required. For instance, fixed-wing aircraft might be excellent communications platforms and able to 
carry out searches and ACO duties, but are not capable of rescue hoist operations. SAR helicopters 
are flexible in their operations, but usually cannot fly as fast, as far, or as high as fixed-wing

aircraft and generally need to refuel more often. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) might have useful 
reconnaissance and communications capabilities and be able to remain on scene for long periods 
of time, but some RPA also have a limited radius of operations. In general, for safety reasons, aircraft 
flown by aircrew and RPA should be kept well apart unless the RPA operator and the aircrew are 
following agreed operating parameters established in their common State regulations.

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
7-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
7.1.7 SAR plans for multiple aircraft operations should be designed to achieve the most effective blend 
of aircraft and surface unit capabilities for the situations that are anticipated. SAR plans should aim 
to achieve continuous and efficient use of aircraft on scene when needed, while minimizing the 
situations in which aircraft are airborne without a mission.

7.1.8 SMCs should consider the abilities of the crew and aircraft when planning and during operations, so 
that no tasks are beyond their abilities.
7.1.9 Under some conditions, SAR aircraft might not be able to operate in accordance with SAR plans. 
Alternative plans should be developed and agreed in advance by SMC and pilots-in-command 
participating in the SAR operation. Alternative courses of action during the mission should also be 
agreed between pilot in command and the SMC.

agreed between pilot in command and the SMC.
 Participation by supplementary aircraft with SAR capability
7.1.10 RCCs may have dedicated civil, military and/or other government SRU aircraft available as part of 
their national SAR plans. In some situations, such as mass evacuations from offshore drilling platforms, 
large-scale incidents over land areas etc., supplementary aircraft with SAR capability belonging to

other commercial companies or other organizations might be able to respond to incidents as part of 
existing emergency plans. During SAR operations, it is essential that the activities of these aircraft be 
coordinated with the overall SAR response in order to reduce the risk of collisions and to make the 
overall operation safe and effective. SAR authorities and SMCs should therefore make agreements also

with these commercial companies and other organizations describing how SAR operations should 
be coordinated, when both dedicated SAR and other aircraft are involved. SAR authorities and SMCs 
should be aware of the SAR capabilities of relevant companies and organizations in their SRRs.
 Refuelling facilities
7.1.11 Use could be made of strategically located aircraft refuelling facilities that exist within range of

an incident. Examples of suitable facilities include airfields, helicopter operating facilities, offshore 
drilling platforms and vessels that can refuel aircraft. SMCs should also consider deploying mobile 
aircraft refuelling facilities closer to distress locations to facilitate more effective SAR operations, 
including faster turnaround times to return to distress locations, especially in helicopter operations.
 Debriefing of SAR mission

Debriefing of SAR mission
7.1.12 Whenever a multiple aircraft SAR operation has taken place, a debrief should be held soon afterwards. 
The debrief should normally be conducted by the RCC in overall charge of coordinating the SAR 
operation. The debrief should include all the relevant units involved in the operation and record 
observations, lessons learned and recommendations to improve future SAR plans and operations. 
7.2 Area of SAR action

7.2 Area of SAR action
7. 2.1 During multiple aircraft SAR operations, SAR aircraft involved should be able to operate free from 
interference from other aircraft and operations. Additionally, aircraft that are not involved in a SAR 
operation need to be informed of the SAR operation and any temporary airspace reservation or 
flight restrictions. SAR authorities should ensure that suitable, temporary areas are agreed in order to

protect SAR operations, unless suitable areas are already available.
 Definition
7 .2.2 The term “area of SAR action” is derived from ICAO procedures for air navigation services (PANS-ATM). 
An area of SAR action is an area of defined dimensions that is established, notified or agreed for the 
purposes of protecting aircraft during SAR operations and within which SAR operations take place. 
There should be an arrangement in place for SMCs to establish an “area of SAR action”.

Establishing areas of SAR action
7. 2. 3 SAR authorities should make arrangements to establish temporary airspace reservation, danger 
areas, restricted areas or other suitable categories of area through appropriate State authorities.

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 7-3
These areas should be agreed and put in place as early as possible during a multiple aircraft SAR 
operation. The guidance for SAR aircraft flying within areas of SAR action are described later in this 
section. For situations in which areas cannot formally be established to protect SAR operations, see 
paragraph 7 .2.10.

paragraph 7 .2.10.
7. 2.4 The dimensions of the required area of SAR action depend on the circumstances and can be different 
over land compared to maritime operations. In general, the horizontal and vertical dimensions of an 
area of SAR action should be large enough to enable safe operations for SRUs, taking into account 
the need for airborne SRUs to safely manoeuvre throughout their mission profile. SAR plans might

involve procedures in which different altitude levels are assigned to different aircraft. This is an 
important consideration whenever any combination of fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and RPA are 
operating in the same area. Factors to be taken into account when considering the dimensions of 
areas of SAR action include the following:
(a) The required extent of SAR activities, including searching.
(b) The need for multiple aircraft to manoeuvre safely.

(c) The need to protect SAR aircraft from other types of operations.
(d) The impact that SAR activities might have on other, neighbouring activities.
 SAR operations within controlled airspace
7. 2. 5 If multiple aircraft SAR operations take place within controlled airspace, then either the ATS should 
control SAR aircraft in accordance with normal ATS procedures or an agreed portion of airspace 
should be temporarily handed over for coordination by an ACO. The ATS unit involved may also be

in a position to carry out some of the duties of an ACO.
 Entering areas of SAR action
7. 2.6 SAR aircraft intending to enter an area of SAR action should not enter the area until the relevant unit 
(RCC, ACO, OSC or responsible ATS unit) gives them approval and provides them with sufficient 
information to safely join the flow of SAR aircraft involved in the operation (see also paragraph 7 .4.2).

Aircraft should call the relevant unit as early as possible before entering the area, in order to allow 
time for information to be exchanged and in case they are required to remain clear of it. As a general 
guide, aircraft should make contact when at least ten minutes’ flying time from the edge of an area 
of SAR action and pass entry information using the format described in appendix T. In the event that

an area of SAR action has been established without an ACO, SAR aircraft should receive information 
that they require primarily from the coordinating RCC or OSC.
 Leaving areas of SAR action
7. 2.7 Aircraft leaving areas of SAR action should contact the relevant unit before the area boundary and 
before changing to another frequency. Aircraft leaving should use the format described in appendix T.
 Flights in areas of SAR action by other aircraft

Flights in areas of SAR action by other aircraft
7. 2.8 Aircraft that are not involved in a SAR operation should normally not fly within areas of SAR action. 
However, if such aircraft need to enter an area of SAR action, they should do so only with the 
approval of an SMC, ACO, OSC or coordinating ATS unit and are subject to the rules of the area or 
the relevant class of airspace. If an SMC or coordinating ATS unit is giving approval, the ACO or OSC 
should first be consulted.

should first be consulted.
7. 2.9 SAR plans should consider providing alerting service for SAR aircraft operating in the Area of SAR 
Action. Although this may normally be provided by the ATS unit responsible, the provision of this 
supplementary service by OSCs or ACOs may assist ATS to reduce their workload, reduce frequency 
congestion and maintain communications in areas of poor ATS radio coverage. It should also be

considered for SAR aircraft operating in areas where no ATS is provided. OSCs or ACOs may 
maintain SAR alerting watch using entry/exit and on-scene scheduled reports by SAR aircraft.

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
7-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
 When areas of SAR action cannot be agreed or used 
7. 2.10 It might not always be possible to formally agree or use an area of SAR action. In such situations, 
SAR authorities, SMCs/OSCs, ACOs and SRUs should, in cooperation with affected ATS units, agree 
suitable coordinates and dimensions within which agreed SAR flying procedures should take place.

Within these coordinates and dimensions, even if no area of SAR action formally exists, procedures 
for multiple aircraft operations should still be applied and flown by the aircraft involved, provided 
that these can be carried out safely.
7.3 Aircraft coordinator (ACO)
 Purpose of an ACO
7. 3.1 The purpose of an ACO is to contribute to flight safety and to perform an efficient SAR operation. 
The ACO should have a clear understanding of the aim of the SAR operation. ACOs should be

prepared and able to coordinate SAR aircraft tasked by an SMC. Particular attention should be paid 
to aircraft that are likely to operate close to each other.
 ACO qualification and training
7. 3. 2 ACOs fulfil a vital function during SAR operations and their duties can be complex and require 
specialist knowledge. Therefore, ACOs need to have experience of relevant operations and/or 
exercises and be specially prepared for their duties. In order to ensure the best standard of SAR

operations and safety, people likely to be designated as ACOs should be specially trained to carry 
out this duty. Once trained, SAR authorities should ensure that exercises take place to train ACOs 
and to practice multiple aircraft operations. RCCs should be aware of trained ACOs in their SRRs and 
establish procedures for tasking them whenever they might be needed for a SAR mission.
 Responsibility for safety

Responsibility for safety
7 .3.3 The safety factors for aircraft involved in a SAR operation should first be assessed by the SMC or 
the OSC in consultation with SAR aircraft pilots-in-command. Assessment procedures should be 
used to assist decisions regarding safety of operations including risk inputs such as number and 
performance of aircraft, capacity for aircraft pilots to deconflict from other aircraft, accuracy of

aircraft navigation capability, manoeuvring requirements, wake turbulence, current and forecast 
weather, sea conditions, terrain, time of day and other applicable risk factors (environmental, aircraft, 
airspace, other air traffic and location).
 Information from ACOs to aircraft on scene is advisory , but should nevertheless be followed as 
closely as practicable. If necessary to ensure flight safety, pilots-in-command should take whatever

measures they assess are needed. If they deviate from advice passed by an ACO, then they should 
inform the ACO as soon as possible. The final decision concerning the safety of an aircraft, its 
crew and passengers rests with the pilots-in-command of the aircraft involved.
 ACO duties
7. 3.4 Procedures, duties and tasks involving ACOs are described throughout this Section. A list of normal 
duties for an ACO, also contained in IAMSAR Manual, volume III, can include the following tasks:

(a) Contributing to flight safety:
 – Maintain a safe flow of aircraft
 – Ensure use of a common altimeter setting for all aircraft involved
 – Advise the SMC/OSC of on-scene weather implications
 – Determine a direction for entering and leaving areas of SAR action
 – Determine all points necessary for maintaining a safe flow of aircraft within the area of 
SAR action

 Designating an ACO
7. 3. 5 Whenever multiple aircraft are taking part in a SAR operation and are likely to operate close to each 
other, SAR authorities should consider designating a person, unit or organization as an ACO.

7.3.6 An ACO is designated by an SMC and should carry out missions under an SMC’s direction. ACOs 
should be notified of their mission as early as possible, in order to give them the maximum time to 
prepare for their tasks.
7. 3.7 There are many factors for SMCs to consider when designating an ACO, however, some significant 
considerations are as follows:
(a) Designating an ACO should be considered when multiple aircraft are involved in a SAR mission.

(b) An ACO should be equipped with appropriate forms of communication for the SAR mission, 
such as the appropriate radios for communicating with aircraft, ATS units, SAR authorities and 
SRUs on the surface. ACO situational awareness can also be assisted by equipping with 
surveillance capabilities such as ADS-B, AIS or other flight tracking capabilities.
(c) An ACO should clearly understand the overall objective of the SAR operation and relevant 
SMC plans.

SMC plans. 
(d) ACOs should be provided with sufficient information to carry out their mission or have access 
to sufficient information.

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
7-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(e) An ACO should know which authority to report to (normally an SMC) and which other units 
are involved in a mission. 
(f) ACOs should be able to reach the required location in sufficient time for them to prepare for 
and carry out their duties.
(g) A person or SAR unit designated as an ACO should have received appropriate training in 
advance.

advance.
h) An ACO should be familiar with the types of aircraft involved and their flying operations.
(i) An ACO should be familiar with SAR operations involving multiple aircraft.
(j) ACOs should ideally be familiar with the environment, normal procedures, activities and air 
traffic systems in the areas of operation.
(k) The time that ACOs may be available to carry out their missions should be considered. If an

ACO is on board an aircraft, then aircraft endurance might limit the amount of time for which 
that ACO can be available.
 ACO location
7. 3.8 ACOs should ideally be as close to the scene of a SAR incident as practicable. However, the choice 
of location of an ACO is flexible, and they should operate in locations which best help them to carry 
out their duties, such as on a fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter, a ship, a fixed structure such as an oil

rig, an ATS unit, a coordinating RCC or another appropriate land unit.
 ACO workload
7. 3.9 The workload of an ACO can be very high. SMCs should bear this factor in mind, when they are 
considering the total number of SRUs that might be required for a SAR operation. An aircraft or 
surface unit designated as an ACO might only be able to carry out the ACO mission and no other 
task due to high workload.
 Coordination with adjacent facilities

Coordination with adjacent facilities
7. 3.10 As much as possible, SMCs should aim to reduce an ACO’s workload by coordinating SAR activities 
taking place within an area of SAR action, with relevant ATS units, airfields and other facilities. 
However, depending on the location and circumstances of an incident, ACOs should also be 
prepared to carry out these duties.
 On-scene altimeter setting

On-scene altimeter setting
7. 3.11 A common altimeter setting should be used by all aircraft within an area of SAR action. This altimeter 
setting might be determined when the first SAR aircraft equipped with a radio altimeter arrives on 
scene. Alternatively, the on-scene altimeter setting can be determined by the ACO, in consultation 
with an ATS unit (when available) an SMC or an OSC (when appropriate). The ACO should pass the 
information to all aircraft in the area of SAR action.

Reporting on-scene activity
7. 3.12 The ACO should make regular reports of on-scene activity to the SMC and aircraft involved in the 
SAR operation. When possible, these reports should be made when ACOs or aircraft are not busy 
with other operational tasks. The radio communications procedures described in paragraph 7 .4.2 
can be used for this purpose; however, other methods might also be appropriate. A general guide

is for ACOs to make reports every thirty minutes during a SAR operation or when anything of 
significance occurs.

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 7-7
 Information from SAR aircraft to the ACO
7. 3.13 In order to enhance situational awareness for ACOs and other SAR aircraft and to assist with safety 
and the continuity of operations, participating aircraft should report as follows:
(a) Entry report.
(b) Reaching assigned points.
(c) Leaving assigned points.

(c) Leaving assigned points.
(d) Commencing operations (search, investigation during search, approach to the surface/ship, 
approach difficulties, hoist, landing etc.).
(e) Completing operations, including information regarding results.
(f) Leaving present altitude.
(g) Reaching new altitude.
(h) 30 minutes on-scene endurance, expecting fuel at (location).
(i) 10 minutes to completing hoist operation.
(j) 10 minutes to completing search.
(k) Exit report.
 Transfer of ACO tasks

(k) Exit report.
 Transfer of ACO tasks
7. 3.14 During some SAR operations, particularly those lasting for long periods of time, it may be necessary 
to transfer the tasks from one ACO to another. This might be due to fatigue, factors affecting an 
ACO’s location, such as the requirement for an ACO’s aircraft to refuel, or for other reasons.
7. 3.15 Before accepting the task the new ACO should understand the details of the SAR operation and

the SMC’s plans. The details required may include the aim of the operation, the position of the 
missing object, number of persons in distress, other units involved, locations of participating aircraft, 
communications and any limitations to the operation. When possible, basic pre-flight information 
should be provided by an SMC in order to simplify the transfer to the new ACO. Examples of 
information that might be of use to ACOs on scene can be found in appendix T-3.

7.3.16 A new ACO will need enough time to obtain information, study it and then prepare to accept the 
task from the previous ACO. Every SAR mission may be different, but as a general guidance, a 
handover of information should begin approximately thirty minutes before a new ACO formally 
takes over.
7. 3.17 A change of ACO might also involve a change of ACO location. If this is the case then, upon 
taking over, the new ACO should make a general communications broadcast announcing the new

information and, whenever possible, obtain acknowledgements from all the participating aircraft. 
A new ACO should inform all participating aircraft that a handover has taken place.
 When to conclude ACO operations
7. 3.18 An SMC is normally in charge of a SAR mission and determines which SRUs take part in it. However, 
in practice, an ACO is often in the best position to advise the SMC, when a SAR operation no longer

requires an ACO. The decision to end ACO operations should normally be made by the SMC that 
designated the ACO, after consulting with relevant organizations and units.
 Checklists and guides
7.3.19 ACOs and SAR aircraft are recommended to use checklists or guides containing relevant information. 
Units who are likely to be designated as ACOs or take part as airborne SRUs in the event of a multiple 
aircraft SAR operation, should always have ACO checklists or guides available whenever they are

on duty. Relevant information for ACOs and SAR aircraft should include procedures for planning,

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
7-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
joining and exiting an area of SAR action, making position reports, holding, conducting searches and 
information about different aircraft types. Checklists and guides suitable for ACOs are contained in 
appendix T.
 Reference information for air crew
7. 3. 20 SAR authorities should ensure that all air crew likely to become involved in multiple aircraft SAR

operations are aware of the procedures. To help with this process, air crew should routinely operate 
and fly with reference information, including IAMSAR Manual, volume III, in case they are required 
to take part in an operation at short notice. Additionally, an operational summary known as the “Pilot 
Information File” (PIF) contains useful in-flight information and is illustrated in appendix T and also 
in IAMSAR Manual, volume III.
7.4 Communications
 ACO call sign

7.4 Communications
 ACO call sign
7.4.1 Large-scale SAR operations can involve units from different organizations or SRRs, which might not 
routinely work together. In order to make the identity of an ACO clear to all participating units, the 
standard call sign: “Air coordinator” should be used by all ACOs.
 Radio voice communications
7.4. 2 There should be agreed, common, on-scene procedures for the following:

(a) On-Scene coordination frequency. An agreed coordination frequency for radio voice 
communications should be used within an area of SAR action. SMCs should consider 
designating a dedicated SAR frequency for aircraft operations, noting 123.1 MHz has been 
reserved internationally for this purpose. The frequency selected should be one which all 
aircraft can access, together with the ACO. The SAR frequency in use should be included in

any NOTAM or other advice to other airspace users as part of the notification about the Area 
of SAR Action. Information that should be passed between an ACO and SAR aircraft is listed in 
appendix T.
(b) Alternative frequencies. Alternative frequencies should also be nominated by an ACO, if the 
agreed coordination frequency is likely to become too busy or unusable. 
(c) Capabilities. Care should be taken to ensure that aircraft and surface units involved in an

operation are capable of complying with the communications procedures.
(d) Communications with an OSC. Consideration should be given to enabling communications 
between an ACO and an OSC. However, it should not normally be necessary for SAR aircraft 
other than an ACO to communicate directly with the OSC.
(e) Radio communications failure procedures. All SAR plans for multiple aircraft SAR operations 
should include procedures for use when radio communications fail. A failure of radio

communications might affect aircraft, SRUs or persons in distress individually, or might involve 
a compromise of radio systems affecting several participants. The systems affected might 
include radio voice communications or radio systems designed to indicate the positions of 
aircraft, vessels or people, including transponders and other devices. In general, the following 
principles should apply to most situations in which radio communications fail:

– Backup means of radio voice communication should be determined and then nominated 
by an ACO, along with the normal communications plan.
 – The backup radio voice communications might include alternative frequencies, alternative 
radio communications systems or both. In the event of a radio communications failure, 
with no alternative airborne communications available, aircraft should normally continue

with their planned timings, events and flight path, still transmitting all position and altitude 
reports, until they are clear of the immediate on-scene area.
 – If an aircraft has not been given a plan when a radio communications failure occurs, then 
it should avoid the on-scene area, departing by an appropriate route and heights.
 – Once clear of the on-scene area, aircraft should consider moving near or landing at a

suitable facility in order to establish communications by alternative methods.
7.4. 3 If radio voice communications cannot be restored, then alternative procedures could be considered 
such as increasing the distances between aircraft using time. If not already included in SAR plans, then 
all participating airborne SRUs might have to be assembled together in order for this procedure to be 
briefed and understood. In most cases, this would result in considerable delays to a SAR operation.

7.4.4 A diagram illustrating a basic example of communications during multiple aircraft SAR operations, 
involving an ACO is described in appendix T.
 Long-range radio communications
7.4. 5 Communications systems designed for long-range SAR operations can be different from the types of 
communications used at shorter ranges. Types of radio equipment that relies on direct ‘line of sight’ 
between a transmitter and receiver may not be suitable for long-range communications between

SMCs and SRUs. Long-range communications methods include the following:
(a) High frequency radio systems.
(b) Satellite communications systems.
(c) Position tracking systems, including those that enable two-way communications. 
(d) The use of high-flying aircraft to relay VHF radio communications to and from lower flying 
SAR aircraft.
(e)  Relay of information to and from SAR aircraft through ATS units.

(f) Relay of information by ships at sea able to communicate with SAR aircraft on marine band 
VHF frequencies, while a shore-based RCC uses satellite, MF or HF communications to 
communicate with the relaying ship(s).
(g) Relay of information by any surface units able to communicate with both SRUs and SMCs.
 SAR aircraft surveillance equipment 
7.4.6 To assist SAR aircraft pilots with situational awareness of other aircraft and vessels in the Area of SAR

Action, the use of SAR aircraft fitted with surveillance equipment such as Traffic Collision Avoidance 
System (TCAS), ADS-B and AIS should be considered. All aircraft operating within and adjacent to 
an area of SAR action should operate with the transponder on.
7.5 Search mission
7. 5.1 The most likely situations in which multiple aircraft might be involved in searches is when large areas 
need to be searched in which the confidence of the datum position is low. The procedures described

below generally assume that visual search techniques are used. However, other technical devices and/
or techniques might also be required or SAR aircraft might only be able to locate persons in distress 
by homing onto transmissions from emergency distress beacons, transponders or other devices. In 
these situations the use of multiple SAR aircraft should be considered carefully in conjunction with

risk assessment procedures to ensure flight safety including assisting pilots-in-command with their 
management of deconfliction from other aircraft.
 Safety and search effectiveness
7. 5. 2 Procedures that ensure flight safety, without making the search ineffective, should be used. Aircraft 
should be given sufficient operational freedom to carry out their searches effectively, but should 
conform to safety procedures provided by the RCC, ACO, OSC or ATS.

7. 5. 3 Methods used to safely keep aircraft apart will depend on the on-scene conditions. Beginning with 
good weather conditions and progressing to poor conditions, methods for keeping aircraft apart to 
enhance flight safety are as follows:
(a) Visual methods.
(b) Flow methods.
(c) Coordination zones.
(d) No fly zones.
 Visual methods

(d) No fly zones.
 Visual methods
7. 5.4 Visual methods involve the allocation of aircraft to search areas and aircraft avoiding each other 
visually. Visual methods may be the only measure necessary when weather conditions on scene are 
good. When using visual methods, the ACO can allow aircraft more freedom of action compared 
to other, more restrictive, methods. However, this freedom will not relieve the need to operate with

due regard to other flight information and reporting requirements as outlined earlier in this section.
 Flow methods 
7 .5.5 Flow methods can be used to assist keeping SAR aircraft apart in slightly poorer conditions, by 
ensuring that they fly the same search patterns (commence search point (CSP)/direction of creep, 
etc.) in adjacent search areas. The first aircraft on scene should be allocated the search area furthest

away from the direction of creep. This method generally enables aircraft to execute effective searches 
of areas with a minimum of radio communication. Aircraft can also be kept apart by using time. This 
method could be used if aircraft arrive on scene at considerably different times, for example as a 
result of departing from different base locations. All aircraft should still be very well informed of each

other to avoid any conflicts, particularly for small track spacings and with high performance aircraft 
turning circles at high speeds before rejoining search legs.
CSP CSP CSP CSP
Direction of creep
7. 5.6 Specific different search altitudes may be assigned for SRUs, to allow an extra margin of safety when 
aircraft operate in close proximity to each other. However, in this situation the effectiveness of the

search may be compromised. An additional consideration is that aircraft may need to deviate from 
their assigned altitude if they need to investigate objects on the surface or drop SAR supplies. All 
aircraft should use the same reference for altitude.

 Coordination zones
7. 5.7 Coordination zones are border areas established between adjacent search areas, which SAR aircraft

can only enter under specific conditions. Coordination zones enable aircraft to have operational 
flexibility within their allocated search areas and ensure a level of safety between them. 
7. 5.8 The dimensions of a coordination zone depend on the on-scene conditions and the size of a search 
area. As a general guide, a coordination zone might be 2 nautical miles across, but this size may be 
increased or decreased if needed. Allowance for aircraft turns at the end of search legs needs to be

considered especially for high speed aircraft. Before entering a coordination zone, aircraft sharing 
the zone should communicate with each in order to safely coordinate the entry. The ACO, OSC or 
RCC should ensure that the aircraft have a clear understanding of their mutual operating areas. The 
aircraft should call again when leaving the zone.

 No fly zones
7. 5.9 If on scene conditions are sufficiently difficult, no fly zones can be used in which flight is not

permitted while searching is taking place in adjacent areas. The dimensions of no fly zones can be 
similar to coordination zones. Whenever no fly zones are used, the ACO should coordinate with the 
SMC and OSC to ensure that the no fly zones are searched appropriately during the SAR operation.

 Investigation of sightings
7. 5.10 Sightings of potential search objects in the search area may require investigation by SAR helicopters

and/or fixed-wing aircraft. This may involve the rescue of survivors, recovery of bodies or retrieval 
of debris or other objects. Procedures within an area of SAR action will also need to allow for all 
participating aircraft to safely manoeuvre during these operations.
7.6 Evacuation missions
 Safety flow procedures
7.6.1 The main aim of on-scene procedures for SAR aircraft should be safety. In general, there are two

methods that can be used to ensure a safe flow of multiple aircraft, which are as follows:
(a) Horizontal spacing. Horizontal spacing of aircraft operating visually should be the basic method 
used by SAR authorities and ACOs. It can be achieved by establishing coordinated specific 
routes to be flown by SAR aircraft to, from and within the area of SAR action.
 The minimum components should include:
 – A direction for entering and leaving the area of SAR action.
 – Entry and exit points.

– Entry and exit points.
 – Adequate horizontal spacing between individual search areas.
 – Same alignment of search legs and direction of creep.
 – Timed entry and exit from individual search areas.
(b) Vertical spacing. Vertical spacing of aircraft can be used in combination with horizontal 
spacing for aircraft operating visually but is a key consideration for safety during poor weather 
conditions when more segregated operations are likely to be required.

(c) In general, altitudes for RPAs should be kept apart from altitudes allocated for other SAR aircraft.
7.6. 2 An effective method to ensure a safe flow of aircraft is by using a combination of both horizontal 
and vertical spacing. The best way to achieve this is through planning by the ACO, OSC or RCC and 
a clear understanding of procedures by all of the units and authorities involved.
7.6. 3 The procedures used by SAR aircraft within an area of SAR action should be determined by the ACO

in consultation with the SMC/OSC and pilots-in-command of the SAR aircraft. The use of assigned

the zone should communicate with each in order to safely coordinate the entry. The ACO, OSC or 
RCC should ensure that the aircraft have a clear understanding of their mutual operating areas. The 
aircraft should call again when leaving the zone.

7. 5.9 If on scene conditions are sufficiently difficult, no fly zones can be used in which flight is not

SMC and OSC to ensure that the no fly zones are searched appropriately during the SAR operation.

(b) Vertical spacing. Vertical spacing of aircraft can be used in combination with horizontal 
spacing for aircraft operating visually but is a key consideration for safety during poor weather 
conditions when more segregated operations are likely to be required.

(c) In general, altitudes for RPAs should be kept apart from altitudes allocated for other SAR aircraft.
7.6. 2 An effective method to ensure a safe flow of aircraft is by using a combination of both horizontal 
and vertical spacing. The best way to achieve this is through planning by the ACO, OSC or RCC and 
a clear understanding of procedures by all of the units and authorities involved.
7.6. 3 The procedures used by SAR aircraft within an area of SAR action should be determined by the ACO

in consultation with the SMC/OSC and pilots-in-command of the SAR aircraft. The use of assigned

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
7-12 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
flight paths, coordinated timings and designated entry and exit procedures will help to ensure a safe 
flow of SAR aircraft. These can be determined by using bearings and distances from features such 
as the casualty location, or described using coordinates such as latitude and longitude. An effective

way to organize multiple SAR aircraft engaged in an evacuation operation is to use procedures based 
on a central reference position (for example a vessel in distress).
7.6.4 Aircraft evacuation and rescue missions will generally involve helicopters; however, fixed-wing 
aircraft may also be involved in supporting these operations, for example during SAR supply-dropping 
operations. Procedures within an area of SAR action should provide for these types of operations

including allowance for safe manoeuvring during drop patterns.
 Aircraft approach and departure flight paths
7.6. 5 Approach and departure flight paths are usually influenced by the prevailing wind direction; factors 
which might also have to be taken into account are:
(a) Fumes directly downwind from burning structures may be unsafe – the direction of approach 
for aircraft might have to be offset from the wind direction.

(b) Geographic features or the design of the casualty location might compel aircraft to approach 
only from specific directions. Structures such as cranes, towers or vertical obstructions in 
line with the wind direction, might be dangerous as physical obstacles or due to mechanical 
turbulence created downwind.
(c) ACOs and SAR aircraft should be informed of all surface vessels, installations or other 
obstructions in the approach and departure sectors and plan to avoid them.

(d) Approach fallback procedures (see 7 .6.8).
7.6.6 Additional considerations for ACOs. The ACO should work together with the SMC, OSC and SAR 
aircraft pilots to minimize the periods with no aircraft at the location of persons in distress. This 
process needs to be managed carefully in order to ensure that all participating aircraft are aware of 
each other and safety and deconfliction is assured.
 Instrument-based procedures

Instrument-based procedures
7.6.7 When weather conditions are so poor that flying operations cannot effectively be carried out 
according to visual procedures and the procedures described earlier in this chapter, then it might 
be possible for an aircraft to operate under instrument-based procedures in an effort to establish 
visual conditions in the area of SAR action. Unless published procedures already exist to and from

the vessel or platform in distress (such as an offshore energy installation) then the use of instrument-
based procedures during a multiple aircraft SAR operation may not be feasible in order to provide 
appropriate safety margins for aircraft involved. A segregated operation may be required where only 
one aircraft can follow instrument-based procedures below a certain level in the area of SAR action

at a time. Unless operations are carried out in controlled airspace under the full control of an ATS 
unit, aircraft pilots-in-command are responsible for avoiding other air traffic and surface obstructions 
in accordance with established regulations of their State for operations in instrument conditions and 
transitioning to visual conditions.
7.6.8 Approach fallback procedures. If on-scene conditions in an area of SAR action prevent a SAR

aircraft from successfully completing an approach to the distress location, then an approach fallback 
procedure should be flown in order to safely rejoin the flow or depart from the area. Approach 
fallback procedures must be briefed to all SAR aircraft by an ACO. The on-scene workload of ACOs 
can be reduced if suitable procedures are described in SAR plans in advance.
7.6.9 If aircraft are required to hold adjacent to the distress location in non-visual conditions while another

aircraft is operating on scene, then vertical spacing should be used for safety purposes. Additional 
vertical spacing may be required where turbulence impacts aircraft ability to safely hold an altitude.
7.7 Long-range operations
7.7.1 Long range is any distance that significantly limits or compromises the ability of SAR aircraft to 
operate on scene effectively and safely.
 Long-range procedures

Long-range procedures
7.7. 2 When flying long distances, SAR aircraft should attempt to reduce fuel consumption while in transit, 
to provide for more additional time on scene. It might be necessary for SAR aircraft to fly as directly 
as possible to and from an incident, with the result that multiple aircraft SAR procedures have to be 
modified and rely on basic safety arrangements. These arrangements could include separate arrival

times on scene and basic inbound and outbound height differences in order to keep aircraft safely 
apart. Additional considerations for long-range SAR communications are described in paragraph 7 .4.5.
7.7. 3 The risks to SRUs during long-range SAR operations should be considered carefully before long-range 
SAR operations take place, including the following:
(a) Overall urgency to save life.
(b) Distance offshore or from suitable aerodrome or helicopter landing site.
(c) Nature of the mission.

(c) Nature of the mission.
(d) Performance characteristics and technical limitations of aircraft taking part in the mission.
(e) Communications.
(f) Availability and effectiveness of flight following equipment: satellite tracking; ATS radar picture, 
etc.
(g) Likelihood of locating the relevant person in distress, vessels or platforms.
(h) The risk to SRUs in the event of an accident.
(i) Current and forecast weather conditions en route and on scene.
(j) Sea state/swell.

(j) Sea state/swell.
(k) Available daylight and amount of darkness on scene (at night).
(l) Size, shape and characteristics of the casualty vessel, platform or location.
(m) Location of persons in distress on a vessel (e.g. should they be moved to a suitable position for 
rescue hoist operations).
(n) The proximity of refuelling facilities to the persons in distress.
(o) The availability of diversions or locations for temporary landing (e.g. offshore energy installations,

 Bringing a casualty vessel within range
7.7.4 If the casualty is on a moving vessel, SMCs should consider the possibility of requesting it to move 
to a point within the effective range of SAR aircraft or other forms of assistance. Alternatively, it 
might be possible for SAR aircraft to refuel at locations that effectively bring a casualty within their

maximum radius for SAR operations. It could also be effective for SMCs to use both of these options 
at the same time.
7.8  Effects of the environment and weather
7.8.1 Factors such as the type of environment and weather can significantly affect the conduct of multiple 
aircraft SAR operations. It is important that SAR authorities establish plans that contain procedures

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 7-13
7.7 Long-range operations
7.7.1 Long range is any distance that significantly limits or compromises the ability of SAR aircraft to 
operate on scene effectively and safely.
 Long-range procedures
7.7. 2 When flying long distances, SAR aircraft should attempt to reduce fuel consumption while in transit,

to provide for more additional time on scene. It might be necessary for SAR aircraft to fly as directly 
as possible to and from an incident, with the result that multiple aircraft SAR procedures have to be 
modified and rely on basic safety arrangements. These arrangements could include separate arrival 
times on scene and basic inbound and outbound height differences in order to keep aircraft safely

apart. Additional considerations for long-range SAR communications are described in paragraph 7 .4.5.
7.7. 3 The risks to SRUs during long-range SAR operations should be considered carefully before long-range 
SAR operations take place, including the following:
(a) Overall urgency to save life.
(b) Distance offshore or from suitable aerodrome or helicopter landing site.
(c) Nature of the mission.
(d) Performance characteristics and technical limitations of aircraft taking part in the mission.

(e) Communications.
(f) Availability and effectiveness of flight following equipment: satellite tracking; ATS radar picture, 
etc.
(g) Likelihood of locating the relevant person in distress, vessels or platforms.
(h) The risk to SRUs in the event of an accident.
(i) Current and forecast weather conditions en route and on scene.
(j) Sea state/swell.
(k) Available daylight and amount of darkness on scene (at night).
(l) Size, shape and characteristics of the casualty vessel, platform or location.

(m) Location of persons in distress on a vessel (e.g. should they be moved to a suitable position for 
rescue hoist operations).
(n) The proximity of refuelling facilities to the persons in distress.
(o) The availability of diversions or locations for temporary landing (e.g. offshore energy installations, 
etc.) 
(p)  Aircrew capabilities or skill levels.
(q) Aircrew fatigue.

at the same time.
7.8  Effects of the environment and weather
7.8.1 Factors such as the type of environment and weather can significantly affect the conduct of multiple 
aircraft SAR operations. It is important that SAR authorities establish plans that contain procedures

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
7-14 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
for all of the weather conditions likely to be encountered. As a general principle, it is usually better 
to plan for poor conditions and to then modify procedures if better conditions permit. As weather 
and environmental conditions become worse, the risks for both the persons in distress and rescuers 
increase and the speed at which SAR operations can take place becomes slower.

7.8. 2   Some weather conditions might prevent certain types of SRU from operating, while other types 
of SRU can still continue. For example, conditions such as very poor visibility at sea might limit 
or prevent airborne SRUs operations, but might not prevent surface rescue craft from operating. 
Heavy seas might make ship to ship transfers of persons in distress unacceptably dangerous, while

helicopter hoist operations can continue. Poor weather conditions at airfields, places of safety, along 
coastlines or along an intended route can affect SRUs and prevent them from departing for or 
fulfilling their SAR missions.
7.8. 3 In extreme situations the risks to SRUs and persons in distress of attempting a SAR operation might 
be sufficiently high that operations cannot take place at all, until conditions improve. There are

many factors that can affect multiple aircraft SAR operations; several of the more common ones are 
outlined below.  
(a) Wind direction – General. Wind direction can have a strong influence on search patterns flown by 
aircraft and the directions of approach and departure by aircraft to persons in distress. Generally, 
approaches and departures by aircraft are flown into wind. Geographic features, characteristics

of the casualty vessel or structure, might mean that approach and departure directions have to 
be modified. Additionally, if the location of persons in distress is on a burning structure, then 
smoke and fumes may be dangerous and airborne SRUs should avoid flying directly downwind 
of the source. The wind direction might have a significant influence on a SAR operation and 
multiple aircraft SAR procedures should be designed with this principle in mind.

(b) Strong winds – Maritime operations. Strong winds can present significant difficulties for aircraft, 
whether operating on their own or together with other aircraft. During maritime operations, 
rescue attempts from surface vessels with large amounts of movement (heaving and rolling) due 
to heavy seas can be extremely dangerous. Strong winds and high sea states can affect even 
the largest vessels, sufficiently to prevent helicopters from landing on helicopter decks. Strong

winds can also make rescue hoist operations extremely difficult. Air turbulence downwind of 
large vertical structures such as offshore platforms, wind farms or the superstructures of large 
vessels and large topographical features with high elevations such as islands/rock features can 
be dangerous for aircraft operations.
(c) Strong winds – Moisture and atmosphere . Strong winds can significantly affect transit times

for aircraft and might limit the ranges at which they can operate. Moisture from the sea can 
be stirred up into the atmosphere at least 1,000 ft above sea level. This moisture can decrease 
visibility and in very cold conditions can cause ice to build up on aircraft structures. Moisture 
that has a high salt content can also reduce aircraft engine performance enough to limit the 
amount of people and cargo that can be carried and make aircraft operations unsafe.

(d) Strong winds – Over land operations. Strong winds over land can result in turbulence in the 
air that is dangerous for aircraft. Turbulence can be particularly severe in mountainous areas, 
near cliffs  and for significant distances downwind of hills and mountains. In very strong 
winds, horizontal visibility is usually reduced; this is most noticeable both in and downwind 
of dry, dusty regions such as deserts. A similar, but usually more local affect can take place in

snow-covered regions. Multiple aircraft SAR operations can be significantly affected by such 
events and may not be able to take place at all until conditions improve.
(e) Low cloud and poor visibility . Low cloud can reduce visibility and restrict the amount of 
altitude in which SAR aircraft can manoeuvre. Low cloud and poor visibility also reduce the 
effectiveness of SAR operations or even prevent them altogether.

(f) Adjusting SAR plans. Some SAR authorities have plans for multiple aircraft operations that 
enable them to operate in conditions of poor visibility, sometimes relying on ATS units and 
good levels of training. During maritime operations, some aircraft are themselves capable of

Chapter 7 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations – General guidance
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 7-15
finding and flying to vessels in conditions of very poor visibility. This procedure may only be 
possible if carried out by aircraft and aircrew capable of this type of flying. At the very least, 
poor visibility will significantly slow down the speed at which multiple aircraft operations can 
be conducted, compared with operations in good weather. In many situations, low cloud and

poor visibility may prevent these operations from taking place at all, until conditions improve.
(g) Darkness. During darkness distances are more difficult to visually assess than during daylight 
and aircraft often need to maintain greater horizontal and vertical spacing from each other.
 Night vision devices
7.8.4 Night vision devices are often being worn by SAR aircrew, as they can compensate for the effects of

darkness. When used appropriately, night vision devices significantly improve safety and effectiveness 
over land as well as in coastal and maritime operations.
7.8. 5 Although using night vision devices can improve multiple aircraft SAR operations, these devices can 
be affected by the weather conditions at night in a similar way that visual flying can be affected by 
day. Night vision devices also need at least a small amount of light in order to work adequately.

7.8.6 The visual conditions at night are affected by many factors, including the amount of moonlight, 
cloud and lighting made by human activity, such as structures and buildings. All authorities and units 
involved in SAR operations in which night vision devices are used should be aware of the effect that 
weather and light conditions can have on their performance. In very dark conditions, such as when

there is no moon at all and significant clouds, night vision devices may be of little use during a SAR 
operation.
 Effect of artificial lighting on night vision devices
7.8.7  Night vision systems can be adversely affected by powerful sources of artificial lighting, such as 
searchlights and pyrotechnic flares used by SRUs. These light sources should not be used without 
prior warning or agreement with SAR aircraft on scene.

Chapter 8
Emergency assistance other than search and rescue
8.1 General
8.1.1 SAR services may be required to perform operations other than search and rescue, which, if not 
carried out, could result in a SAR incident, such as:
 – assisting a ship or aircraft which is in a serious situation and in danger of becoming a casualty, 
thereby endangering persons on board;
 – broadcasting of maritime safety information (MSI);

– alerting appropriate authorities of unlawful acts being committed against an aircraft or ship; and
 – assisting after the ship or aircraft has been abandoned, to minimize future hazards.
 MSC.1/Circ.1183 contains guidance on the provision of external support as an aid to incident 
containment.
8.1.2 Even when a SAR service is not responsible in a given area, it may be called upon to assist other

emergency response authorities. For those situations where the assistance of SAR services may be 
anticipated, suitable operating plans should be developed that include provisions for coordination 
with other authorities, as appropriate. However, in many cases, these requirements cannot be 
foreseen and SAR personnel may have to provide an appropriate response without any existing plan.
8.2  Intercept and escort services

8.2  Intercept and escort services
8.2.1 The main purpose of intercept and escort services is to minimize delay in reaching the scene of 
distress and to eliminate a search for survivors. Escort service for both aircraft and vessels will 
normally be provided to the nearest adequate aerodrome or nearest safe haven for vessels (safe 
mooring and with a means of communications such as a telephone). Escorts can also often provide

various types of assistance should the escorted craft be unable to arrive at a safe place under its own 
power. Procedures to develop intercepts are in appendix J.
8.2.2 The following assistance can be provided by an escort:
 – moral support to the persons on board the distressed craft, assuring them that assistance is 
immediately available;
 – navigation and communication functions for the distressed craft, permitting its crew to 
concentrate on coping with the emergency;

concentrate on coping with the emergency;
 – inspection of the exterior of the distressed craft;
 – advice on procedures for aircraft ditching, including ditching heading, or for abandoning or 
beaching a vessel;
 – illumination during aircraft ditching or vessel abandonment, or assistance in the approach 
procedure at the destination;
 – immediate provision of emergency and survival equipment, if any, carried by the escort facility; 
and
 – direction of rescue facilities to the distress scene.

Chapter 8 – Emergency assistance other than search and rescue 
8-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
8.2.3 In an uncertainty phase, the SMC may alert SAR facilities capable of providing an escort facility. If 
the incident progresses to an alert or distress phase, the SMC may then dispatch the escort facility 
immediately. Even when it appears too late for the intercepting facility to effect the intercept, it 
should be dispatched to begin the search.

should be dispatched to begin the search.
8.2.4 An aircraft may be considered to need an escort when:
 – navigation or radio equipment is suspect;
 – it is unable to maintain altitude;
 – it has suffered structural damage;
 – it is on fire or fire is suspected;
 – the pilot’s control of the aircraft is impaired;
 – remaining fuel is suspected to be insufficient;
 – fewer than three out of four, or fewer than two out of three engines are operating normally; or

– it is threatened by any other grave and imminent danger.
8.2.5 A ship may be considered to need an escort when:
 – its stability is endangered (e.g. taking in water or cargo shifting);
 – it has suffered actual or suspected structural damage;
 – it is on fire or fire is suspected;
 – the master’s control of the vessel is impaired;
 – remaining fuel is suspected to be insufficient;
 – its steering gear is defective; or
 – it is threatened by any other grave and imminent danger.

8.2.6 The following information regarding the distressed craft should be given to the intercepting facility:
 – description, including call sign and other identification marks;
 – position at a specified time and type of navigation aids used;
 – heading and drift (or track);
 – speed over the ground or water;
 – if an aircraft, whether maintaining altitude, climbing, or descending;
 – number of persons at risk; and
 – brief description of the emergency.

– brief description of the emergency.
8.2.7 Accurate navigation by both the distressed craft and the intercepting facility is the most important 
factor when effecting an intercept.
8.2.8 When visual contact has been made, the intercepting aircraft will normally take up a position slightly 
above, behind and to the left of the distressed craft. Aircraft can escort ships.
8.2.9 A ship carrying out an interception should stand by the distressed craft until the danger is past, unless

given instructions to the contrary.
8.3  Safety information
8.3.1 Maritime safety information (MSI), such as weather forecasts and warnings of hazards to navigation, 
is promulgated by SAR, meteorological, and navigation authorities. These authorities make 
arrangements for broadcast of MSI- and SAR-related information by means that may include NAVTEX, 
EGC services, and MF, VHF and HF radio. Broadcast of MSI can serve to prevent SAR incidents from

occurring. Similar safety information may be promulgated for aircraft and distributed as arranged by 
aeronautical authorities.
8.4  Unlawful acts
8.4.1 The RCC may become aware of an aircraft known or believed to be subject to unlawful interference. 
ATS units would usually become aware of the situation first and would be responsible. The RCC 
should declare an alert phase, advise appropriate authorities (ATS units if not already aware, and

response agencies specified in the plans of operation), and begin preparations for possible SAR 
operations as appropriate.
8.4.2 In situations such as piracy or armed robbery against ships where the ship or crew is in grave and 
imminent danger, the master may authorize the broadcasting of a distress message, preceded by the 
appropriate distress alerts (MAYDAY, DSC, etc.), using all available radiocommunications systems.

Also, ships subject to the SOLAS Convention are required to carry equipment called the Ship 
Security Alert System (SSAS) for sending covert alerts to shore for vessel security incidents involving 
acts of violence against ships (i.e. piracy, armed robbery against ships or any other security incident 
directed against a ship). The system is intended to allow a covert activation to be made which alerts

the competent authority ashore and denies knowledge of its activation to perpetrators of the acts of 
violence. Under the SSAS concept, national governments should establish a security forces authority 
to be in charge of providing the response to such security incidents. The RCC, due to it being 
available on a 24-hour basis, is often the first point of contact between the ship and coastal authori-

ties concerned. Two common systems for transmitting SSAS alerts are Inmarsat and Cospas-Sarsat.  
(A sample SSAS alert message is found in appendix B, under RCC–Cospas-Sarsat message formats.) 
National procedures can vary but the role of the RCC, if involved, is usually to receive the SSAS alert 
and inform the security forces authority that will be in charge of the response. Actions taken by the 
RCC upon receiving a covert SSAS alert include: 
 – do not acknowledge receipt of the alert;

– do not acknowledge receipt of the alert; 
 – do not attempt to contact the ship originating the alert;
 – do not send any communications to other ships in the vicinity of the ship under threat unless 
directed by the security forces authority;
 – if the position of the incident is within its SRR, the RCC should immediately inform its national 
security forces authority; 
 – if the position of the incident is outside of its SRR, the RCC should relay the alert to the

appropriate RCC using the normal methods of communication; and 
 – place SAR resources on standby, if appropriate, since it may become a SAR case.
8.5  Search and rescue outside of RCC responsible areas
8.5.1 SAR services may be called upon for assistance by other emergency services in areas that are not in 
their normal area of responsibility. Examples of these situations include:
 – SAR in estuaries, rivers, lakes, harbours, and flooded areas;

– rescue of injured personnel from inaccessible or remote land areas or areas accessible by 
water but not accessible by land, such as seaside cliffs;
 – major incidents where there are large numbers of casualties; and
 – medical evacuation when primary services are unable to perform the mission, such as by ship 
from a small coastal island when weather prohibits the evacuation by aircraft.
8.5.2 In certain exceptional situations, evacuation by sea may be the only way to save persons on land

from an imminent danger that has trapped them on the coast or small island. Forest fires, volcanic 
eruptions, and industrial accidents causing the discharge of hazardous materials are examples of 
such situations. When these types of situations occur, SAR services may be the only emergency 
organization capable of performing the evacuation. In most of these cases, harbour installations 
would probably not be available and hazardous conditions would most likely prevent the use of

aircraft or helicopters.

Chapter 8 – Emergency assistance other than search and rescue 
8-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
8.6  Assistance to property
8.6.1 The primary concern of SAR operations is assistance to persons in distress. However, chapter 5 of the 
IAMSAR Manual, volume I, Organization and Management points out some factors and reasons for 
consideration of saving property. Variations of the terms “saving” and “salving” are commonly used

internationally regarding removal of property from risk. Commercial salvage companies may become 
involved during or after SAR operations. SAR personnel on scene are usually in the best position to 
assess what actions are necessary to minimize future hazards such as pollution from cargo or fuel 
spills and ships becoming hazards to navigation or vessels, craft or life-saving appliances left adrift

at sea that may cause an unnecessary SAR alert in the future. Action such as towing or temporary 
repairs or recovery by the SAR facility may be able to prevent more complicated problems later. 
However, SAR facilities typically are not experts in salvage operations, so the SMC must consider 
their capabilities and the risks to them. Judgements about the stability of a damaged vessel, or 
whether freeing a grounded vessel will improve or worsen the situation, can be very difficult to 
make.

make.
8.6.2 When a salvage vessel is at the scene of the distress or en route to it, the SRU involved should verify 
whether the salvage vessel is prepared to effect salvage, and whether this assistance is acceptable to 
the distressed craft. If not, the SRU should render assistance as necessary to ensure the safety of life.
8.7 Aerodrome emergency plan
8.7.1 Annex 14 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation provides for an Aerodrome Emergency

Plan. As recommended in annex 14, the plan should provide for cooperation and coordination 
with the rescue coordination centre, as necessary. This Plan is maintained to minimize the number 
of personal injuries and the extent of property damage resulting from an emergency. These Plans 
focus on emergency services and resources available to aerodrome and local emergency service 
organizations. Cooperation and coordination between the aerodrome operators and the RCC should

be promoted for the provision of mutual assistance. The plan is to include the ready availability of, 
and coordination with, appropriate specialist rescue services to be able to respond to emergencies 
where an aerodrome is located close to water and/or swampy areas or difficult terrain and where a 
significant portion of approach or departure operations takes place over these areas.
8.7. 2 Aerodromes should make provisions with local SAR service providers for water rescue and mass

casualties near aerodromes, as appropriate. The aerodrome emergency plan is required to contain 
procedures for periodic testing of the adequacy of the plan and for reviewing the results in order to 
improve its effectiveness. Testing may be by joint exercises conducted so that:
 – aerodrome operators understand the SAR service organization, capabilities, and limitations; 
and
 – SAR facilities become familiar with the aerodrome layout, support facilities, and access points.

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 9-1
Chapter 9
Conclusion of SAR operations
9.1 General
9.1.1 SAR operations enter the conclusion stage when:
 – information is received that the ship, aircraft, other craft, or persons who are the subject of the 
SAR incident are no longer in distress;
 – the ship, aircraft, other craft, or persons for whom SAR facilities are searching have been 
located and the survivors rescued; or

located and the survivors rescued; or
 – during the distress phase, the SMC or other proper authority determines that further search 
would be to no avail because additional effort cannot appreciably increase the probability 
of successfully finding any remaining survivors or because there is no longer any reasonable 
probability that the distressed persons have survived.
9.2  Closing a SAR case

9.2  Closing a SAR case
9.2.1 The authority to terminate a case sometimes rests with different levels within the SAR organization 
depending on the circumstances dictating that the incident be closed or active search suspended. 
In particular, the responsible SC or other SAR managers may retain the authority to suspend a case 
when the subjects of a search have not been found, and may delegate to the SMC the authority to

close cases in all other circumstances, i.e. when the SMC determines that the craft or people are no 
longer in distress. In areas not under the responsibility of an RCC, or where the responsible centre is 
not able to coordinate the operations, the OSC may need to take responsibility for deciding when to 
suspend or close the search.
9.2.2 Most SAR operations typically conclude when those in distress are no longer in distress or are

rescued and rescue personnel and facilities are returning to normal duties. The basic steps to closing 
this type of case are:
 – notify immediately all authorities, centres, services, or facilities that have been activated; and
 – complete a record of the case.
9.3  Suspending search operations
9.3.1 Some cases may require extended searching. At some point, the proper authority must make the 
difficult decision to suspend active search operations pending the receipt of additional information.

That is, the authority must decide that additional search effort will not result in success. In making this 
decision, each SAR incident must be considered on its own merits, and care should be taken not to 
end the search prematurely. The decision to suspend a search involves humanitarian considerations, 
but there is a limit to the time and effort that can be devoted to each SAR case.
9.3.2 Prior to suspending search operations, a thorough case review should be made. The decision to

suspend operations should be based on an evaluation of the probability that there were survivors 
from the initial incident, the probability of survival after the incident, the probability that any survivors 
were within the computed search area, and the effectiveness of the search effort as measured by

Chapter 9 – Conclusion of SAR operations
9-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
the cumulative probability of success. The reasons for search suspension should be clearly recorded. 
The case review should also examine:
 – search decisions for proper assumptions and reasonable planning scenarios;
 – certainty of initial position and any drift factors used in determining search area;
 – significant clues and leads re-evaluated;
 – data computations;
 – the search plan, to ensure that:

– the search plan, to ensure that:
 – all assigned areas were searched;
 – the probability of detection is as high as desired; and
 – compensation was made for search degradation caused by weather, navigational, 
mechanical, or other difficulties; and
 – the determination about the survivability of survivors, considering:
 – time elapsed since the incident;
 – environmental conditions (appendix N provides information on some of the environmental 
factors);

factors);
 – age, experience, and physical condition of potential survivors;
 – survival equipment available; and
 – studies or information relating to survival in similar situations.
9.3.3 A search should normally be terminated only when there is no longer any reasonable hope of 
rescuing survivors from the SAR incident. Considerations for suspending a search include:
 – all assigned areas have been thoroughly searched;
 – all reasonable probable locations have been investigated;

– all reasonable means of obtaining information about the whereabouts of the ship, aircraft, 
other craft, or persons who are the subject of the search have been exhausted; and
 – all assumptions and calculations used in search planning have been reviewed.
9.3.4 The SMC should advise the relatives of the missing persons that the search has been suspended. 
Relatives are normally more willing to accept the decision to suspend operations if they have been

allowed to follow the progress of the search. The SMC should have maintained regular contact with 
relatives during the search, as discussed in section 1.10, to provide information and outline future 
plans. Providing access to the RCC, or if not co-located, to the SMC headquarters, if appropriate, 
enables relatives to see the search effort. Notification of the decision to terminate should normally

be made at least one day prior to suspension of operations, allowing relatives at least one more day 
of hope, while giving them time to accept that the search cannot continue indefinitely.
9.3.5 When a search has proven unsuccessful and the SMC has suspended search operations, others 
concerned, e.g. the operating agency of the missing craft, may continue the search. These activities 
should, if requested, be coordinated by the RCC.

should, if requested, be coordinated by the RCC.
9.3.6 The RCC should maintain a suspended case file, which should be periodically reviewed so that 
the operations can be re-activated without delay if additional information develops which justifies 
engaging in renewed search efforts.
9.4  Reopening a suspended case
9.4.1 If significant new information or clues are developed, reopening of a suspended case should be

considered. Reopening without good reason may lead to unwarranted use of resources, risk of injury 
to searchers, possible inability to respond to other emergencies, and false hopes among relatives.
9.5  Final reports
9.5.1 When a SAR case is closed or search efforts are suspended, every authority, centre, service, or facility 
activated should be notified. This is normally done via radio or telephone, and then followed by a

final situation report (SITREP) from the RCC. To ensure that search facilities remain under some type 
of flight or vessel following system, the RCC should not stand down its efforts until all resources have 
established alternate following plans, where appropriate. Other RCCs involved should be notified of 
the conclusion of SAR operations, especially if responsibility for the case was assumed from another 
RCC, such as the first RCC to receive the distress alert.

9.5.2 If the RCC Chief and the responsible managers were not involved in a search suspension decision, 
they should be informed about the lack of success and the reasons for halting operations.
9.5.3 A record of SAR operations is required to improve methods, evaluate mistakes, if any, and provide 
statistics for SAR managers to justify SAR system support. This record should include information

from debriefing of survivors as discussed in section 6.18. If the SAR service maintains computer files 
of SAR cases, appropriate information from this case file should be extracted and entered into the 
database for future analysis.
9.6 Performance improvement
9.6.1 Constant improvement in the performance of the SAR system should be a clearly stated goal of SAR 
managers. One method to encourage performance improvement is to set up goals whose degree of

attainment can be measured by key performance data. This data should be collected, analysed, and 
published on a routine basis so that individuals can see how the system as a whole is doing, and how 
their performance is contributing to the achievement of the established goals.
9.6.2 Performance management is the framework of processes and procedures used to ensure that an 
organization or unit can fulfil its objectives. Traditionally, organizational effectiveness was based on

narrow performance measurement systems. Performance management should be considered as a

9.5  Final reports
9.5.1 When a SAR case is closed or search efforts are suspended, every authority, centre, service, or facility 
activated should be notified. This is normally done via radio or telephone, and then followed by a 
final situation report (SITREP) from the RCC. To ensure that search facilities remain under some type

of flight or vessel following system, the RCC should not stand down its efforts until all resources have 
established alternate following plans, where appropriate. Other RCCs involved should be notified of 
the conclusion of SAR operations, especially if responsibility for the case was assumed from another 
RCC, such as the first RCC to receive the distress alert.
9.5.2 If the RCC Chief and the responsible managers were not involved in a search suspension decision,

they should be informed about the lack of success and the reasons for halting operations.
9.5.3 A record of SAR operations is required to improve methods, evaluate mistakes, if any, and provide 
statistics for SAR managers to justify SAR system support. This record should include information 
from debriefing of survivors as discussed in section 6.18. If the SAR service maintains computer files 
of SAR cases, appropriate information from this case file should be extracted and entered into the

database for future analysis.
9.6 Performance improvement
9.6.1 Constant improvement in the performance of the SAR system should be a clearly stated goal of SAR 
managers. One method to encourage performance improvement is to set up goals whose degree of 
attainment can be measured by key performance data. This data should be collected, analysed, and 
published on a routine basis so that individuals can see how the system as a whole is doing, and how

their performance is contributing to the achievement of the established goals.
9.6.2 Performance management is the framework of processes and procedures used to ensure that an 
organization or unit can fulfil its objectives. Traditionally, organizational effectiveness was based on 
narrow performance measurement systems. Performance management should be considered as a 
holistic and continuous process which enlists the human dimension to set organizational direction,

monitoring and measuring performance and taking corrective action as required.
9.6.3 The Balanced Scorecard approach to performance management assists managers to look at the 
business from different perspectives and take into account their linkages. The following four 
perspectives form the basis of a Balanced Scorecard approach of key indicators which identify 
which processes and activities are most important for fulfilling the organization’s or unit’s mission.

 In addition to the four perspectives outlined above, SAR managers should regularly review their 
performance management system and reviews should be inclusive of staff. SAR managers are also

encouraged to develop and implement a training programme for all staff on performance management 
and quality assurance systems.
9.7 Case studies
9.7.1 Sometimes a SAR case has a surprise ending, as when the survivors are found by someone not 
involved in the search effort in a location outside the search area, or they are found, alive and well, 
in the search area after the search effort has been suspended. There are also occasions when there

seems to have been an unusual number of problems in spite of the best efforts of the SAR personnel. 
Finally, there may be important and valuable lessons to learn from a SAR incident and the subsequent 
response of the SAR system that would be revealed only by a careful after-the-fact review.
(a) A SAR case study is an appropriate method for addressing those aspects of an incident that are of 
particular interest. Individual aspects of interest could include problems with communications,

assumptions made, scenario development, search planning, or international coordination. SAR 
case studies or incident reviews also provide opportunities to analyse survivor experiences 
and life-saving equipment performance. Survival in hostile environments is affected by many 
variables, including the physical condition of the survivors, survivor actions, reinforcement 
given by rescue forces prior to rescue, and the effectiveness of safety or survival equipment.

Knowing more about these factors can help the SAR system become more effective.
(b) When used to review and evaluate all aspects of a response to an incident, SAR case studies are 
one of the most valuable and effective tools for improving SAR system performance. Therefore, 
SAR case studies or reviews should be performed periodically even when no problems are 
apparent. There is almost always room for improvement, especially in large, complex cases. The

most important outcome, however, is that early detection and correction of apparently small 
problems or potential problems will prevent them from growing into serious deficiencies later.
9.7. 2 The discussion on case review in paragraph 9.3.2 provides topics that typically may be examined 
during a case study.
9.7. 3 To get a balanced view, SAR case studies should be done by more than one person; the case study

team should include recognized experts in those aspects of the case being reviewed. To achieve 
maximum effectiveness, case studies should not assign blame, but rather, should make constructive 
suggestions for change where analysis shows that such change will improve future performance.
9.7.4 When carrying out a case study, it is suggested that the following four components of crisis 
management are analysed: 
 – Report and alarm.
 – Scale up and scale down.
 – Leadership and coordination.

– Leadership and coordination.
 – Information management.
 In carrying out a case study, guidelines for the evaluation should be drawn up beforehand. The 
guidelines should specify when to review a SAR incident, which areas should be paid attention 
to, what standards it should be measured against, who has to carry out the evaluation and what 
has to happen with conclusions or findings. An example of an evaluation format can be found in

appendix H-10 “Guideline for case study evaluation – Example of an incident evaluation form”. 
9.7. 5 In addition to SAR cases, accidents, exercises and drills should be carefully assessed and potential 
improvements to the SAR system identified. Lessons identified in such cases, and other information 
of use to the SAR community, should be shared as appropriate at local, national, regional and/or 
international level. States should consider whether to make formal reports to IMO and/or ICAO.

The International Maritime Rescue Federation also provides an information-sharing platform: see 
volume I, appendix D “Information sources”. See also “Incident debriefings”, below.
9.8  Archiving case files
9.8.1 All information pertaining to a specific SAR incident should be placed in an easily identified and 
labelled file folder and then placed in storage. Length of time to retain these records in storage is

the decision of the SAR managers. Some States retain all records for a few years and then place files 
dealing with significant, historically important, or sensitive incidents into permanent secure storage, 
discarding those involved only with routine situations. Defining which files belong in the “routine” 
category is, again, a SAR manager matter. Files pertaining to incidents that become the subject of

legal proceedings must be retained until those proceedings are complete, including all appeals and 
legal reviews. Files that are to be permanently retained should be prominently marked so that they 
are not inadvertently thrown out when the routine files are discarded.
9.9 Incident debriefings
9.9.1 Debriefings, feedback sessions and experience sharing opportunities between the crews of SAR 
facilities, SMCs and SCs are methods of quality control and continuous improvement to a SAR

system. To benefit from this process, SAR authorities should establish a structured and systematic 
approach to debriefing. Of particular significance would be the following matters:
(a) extent of the debriefings (what experiences need to be shared);

facilities, SMCs and SCs are methods of quality control and continuous improvement to a SAR

system. To benefit from this process, SAR authorities should establish a structured and systematic 
approach to debriefing. Of particular significance would be the following matters:
(a) extent of the debriefings (what experiences need to be shared);

Chapter 9 – Conclusion of SAR operations
9-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(b) focus of the debriefing (strive to focus on the most important issues);
(c) level of participation at the debriefing;
(d) definition of participants’ needs; and
(e) process of information flow from the debriefing (normally from the bottom up).
 Although each level of debriefing targets a specific audience, significant benefits can be derived

from conducting simultaneous/joint debriefings in which all parties participate. It is important to 
note that improvements to a SAR system will not be obtained unless recommendations identified by 
debriefings are reviewed and implemented.
9.9.2 Types of debriefing can be grouped into three categories: operations, liaison and administration. Each 
category deals with specific segments of an operation that normally includes the following aspects:
(a) Operations:
 –  operations/response;

(a) Operations:
 –  operations/response;
 –  coordination;
 – communications;
 – reporting;
 – debriefing; and
 – logs and documents.
(b) Liaison:
 – participation in briefings/courses held by various SAR providers;
 – seminars/workshops/working groups;
 – RCC staff visits to sub-units/agencies/groups;
 – joint exercises;
 – visits to neighbouring countries; and
 – participation in international events.
(c) Administration:
 – command, communication and control structure;

– command, communication and control structure;
 – policy and regulations;
 – personnel; and
 – administrative support.
9.9.3 The following methods of debriefings could be used to assist SAR authorities to improve their system:
(a) Situation report (SITREP). As described in chapter 2, this method provides the quickest means 
to forward issues of concern to the responsible authorities;
(b) SAR debrief (Search Operation Debriefing Form). As described in chapter 5, this debriefing

form is intended to report actual actions and observations of SAR facilities after each tasking. It 
provides the opportunity to report areas of concern in a more formal way;
(c) SAR mission report.  This method requires the primary rescue facilities to prepare a quick 
description of the tasks and actions taken (see appendix H). This report would provide 
another avenue for responsible authorities to capture previously undisclosed issues of concern.

Concerns may involve issues of broader scope not necessarily apparent at the time of the event;
(d) Formal debriefing session. This debriefing method could be initiated by a participating SAR facility, 
RCC, or a high-level authority and would normally involve an in-depth review of issues of concern. 
Attendance by representatives of all SAR-participating units would be highly desirable. Findings 
and proposed changes/amendments to local procedures would be validated and approved by

those concerned and promulgated to the responsible authorities for implementation. There would

Chapter 9 – Conclusion of SAR operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) 9-7
be no requirement for a specific format as the results of this debriefing would be intended for 
internal use only (distributed among the various emergency service providers); and
(e) SAR operation report.  This method of debriefing would be required after a significant SAR 
incident and/or when issues identified in the operation need to be addressed. The report would

be prepared by the responsible authority in line with the process described in section 9.7 . The 
report would be intended for a wider audience, which could include government departments, 
outside agencies, interested groups, owners and operators. Consequently, an established format 
would be needed to ensure adequacy and consistency of the reports (see appendix H).
9.9.4 The beneficiaries of debriefings and those methods of debriefing best suited to them are described 
in the following table:

Procedural words
AFFIRMATIVE means “yes” i.e. that what a person has transmitted is correct.
BREAK is used to separate portions of a message or one message from another.
FIGURES is spoken just before numbers are given in a message.
I SPELL is used just before a phonetic spelling, such as of a proper name.
NEGATIVE means no.
OUT indicates the end of a transmission when no reply is expected or required.

OVER indicates the end of a transmission when an immediate reply is expected.
ROGER means I have received your transmission satisfactorily.
SILENCE is said three times and means cease all transmissions immediately.
SILENCE FINI (pronounced SEE LONSS FEE NEE) means silence is lifted, and is used to signify the end of the 
emergency and resumption of normal traffic.
THIS IS is said before the station name or call sign which immediately follows.

WAIT means “stand by,” i.e. I must pause for a few seconds; stand by for further transmission.
Distress signals
Some basic distress signals are as follows:
 – “SOS” in Morse Code by any means;
 –  a gun or other explosive fired at intervals of about one minute (tracer bullets can be detected up 
to six miles, but it is difficult to pinpoint survivor location);
 – continuous sounding with any fog signalling apparatus;

– a square flag having above or below it a ball or anything resembling a ball;
 –  flames, e.g. from a burning oil barrel (flames are very effective at night, and have been sighted 
as far away as 50 miles);
 –  red flares, which have been sighted up to 35 miles at night, with an average of 10 miles at night, 
and about 1 to 2 miles during daylight;
 –  orange smoke, effective up to 12 miles during the day if winds are less than 10 knots, with an 
average 8 mile range;

average 8 mile range;
 – slowly and repeatedly raising and lowering arms outstretched to each side;
 – inverted flag;
 –  flashes from a signal mirror, with an average detection range of five miles, but sometimes 
detectable up to 45 miles; and
 –  dye-stained water, normally green or red, has been sighted up to ten miles away, with an average 
detectability of three miles.
Persons in distress may use any means at their disposal to attract  attention, make known their position and

obtain help (SOLAS, chapter IV).
The use of an international distress signal, except for the purpose of indicating that a person is or persons are 
in distress, and the use of any signal which may be confused with an international distress signal are prohibited 
(SOLAS, chapter V).

MRO exercises
Since opportunities to handle actual incidents involving mass rescues are rare and challenging, exercising 
MRO plans is particularly important. MRO exercises provide opportunities to improve MRO preparedness by: 
 – validating plans, policies, doctrine, procedures and the ability to conduct contingency operations; 
 – building, clarifying and strengthening relationships with partners and stakeholders prior to an actual 
MRO incident;

MRO incident;
 – assessing preparedness/readiness with an emphasis on identifying shortfalls and closing gaps;
 – refining plans, identifying available resources and capabilities, conducting training, and evaluating 
training plans; and
 – providing familiarization and on-the-job training for players in their roles and responsibilities for 
conducting contingency operations.
Full-scale live MRO exercises are difficult and costly to arrange, requiring hundreds of people to be rescued

and multiple SAR facilities. MRO exercise objectives need not be addressed in a single large exercise, but 
may be satisfied in part by incorporation into multiple drills, tabletop exercises, command post exercises, etc.  
However, realistic drills are still necessary.
MRO exercises should ideally achieve the following objectives:
 – test:
 – RCC procedures and processes,
 – SAR coordination and communications procedures,
 – communications planning and management,

– communications planning and management,
 – information coordination and management,
 – search planning and search area coverage, and
 – use of systems, equipment and SAR techniques;
 – account for:
 – all involved in the operation,
 – rescued passengers and crew until they can return to their homes,
 – all persons associated with the rescue and aftermath operations, and
 – survival craft, including empty boats or rafts;
 – identify and task available resources:

– identify and task available resources:
 – use of Amver or other ship reporting systems,
 – other potential resources ashore and afloat, including military and other government resources,
 – resources from local agencies (medical personnel, hospital facilities, fire department, general 
community, transportation resources, etc.),
 – on-board support resources, and
 – national and regional resources;

– national and regional resources;
 – evaluate notification processes, resource availability, timeliness of initial response, real-time 
elements, conference capabilities and overall coordination;
 – ensure all agency roles are specified, understood and properly followed;
 – test capabilities of potential OSCs and ability to transfer OSC duties;
 – test capabilities of potential ACOs and ability to transfer ACO duties;

 – evacuate a ship or aircraft;
 – coordinate search and rescue activities and achieve information exchanges:
 – communications (RCC–RCC, Government–industry, RCC–OSC–ACO, on-scene, shore–ship, 
ground–air, ship–air, SAR facility–survival craft, etc.),
 – information for all concerned (identify, merge, purge, retrieve and transfer to the right place

in the right form at the right time),
 – new communication and information management technologies, and
 – media and next of kin;
 – test all communication links that may be needed for notification, coordination and support;
 – test capabilities and techniques for retrieving people into SAR facilities, taking into account high 
freeboard issues etc.;
 – safely transfer and care for passengers (evacuation, in survival craft, rescue, medical, protection

from environment, post-rescue transfers, etc.);
 – provide food, water, lifejackets and other protective clothing to survivors;
 – conduct medical triage and provide first aid;
 – identify place(s) of safety and test landing and transfer procedures;
 – exercise coordination between all responding agencies;
 – test mass rescue plans of:
 – SAR services,
 – operating company (airline, ship operator, etc.),

– any other relevant emergency response organizations, e.g. disaster response, military, fire 
fighting and medical, and
 – transportation and accommodation companies;
 – assess how effectively lessons previously identified have been accounted for in updated plans and 
how well these lessons were shared;
 – exercise salvage and pollution abatement capabilities;
 – carry out emergency relocation of the disabled craft; and

– exercise external affairs, such as international and public relations taking into account:
 – necessary participants involved,
 – joint information centres established quickly and properly staffed,
 – press briefings handled effectively, e.g. consistent information from different sources,
 – notification of the next of kin and family briefings,
 – staff and equipment capacity to handle incoming requests for information, and

– rescued persons tracked, kept informed, needs monitored, and reunited with belongings.
The following steps are normally carried out during exercise planning:
 – agree on the exercise scenario, goals and extent;
 – assemble a multi-disciplinary planning team and agree on objectives for each aspect of the exercise;
 – develop the main events and associated timetables;
 – confirm availability of agencies to be involved, including any media representatives or volunteers;

– confirm availability of transportation, buildings, equipment, aircraft, ships or other needed resources;
 – test all communications that will be used, including tests of radio and mobile phones at or near the 
locations where they will be used;
 – identify and brief all participants and people who will facilitate the exercise, and ensure that 
facilitators have good independent communications with person who will be controlling the 
exercise;

exercise;
 – ensure that everyone involved knows what to do if an actual emergency should arise during the 
exercise;
 – if observers are invited, arrange for their safety and keep them informed about the exercise progress;
 – for longer exercises, arrange for food and toilet facilities;
 – use ”exercise in progress”, signs, advance notifications and other means to help ensure that persons 
not involved in the exercise do not become alarmed;
 – schedule times and places for debriefs;

– schedule times and places for debriefs;
 – agree and prepare conclusions and recommendations with the entity responsible for handling each 
recommendation along with the due date for any actions;
 – prepare a clear and concise report and distribute it as appropriate to the participating organizations 
and more widely, as agreed; and
 – consider the outcome of this exercise in planning future exercises and operations.
MRO industry roles

MRO industry roles
SAR authorities should coordinate MRO plans with companies that operate aircraft and ships designed to 
carry large numbers of persons. Such companies should share in preparations to minimize the chances that 
MROs will be needed, and to ensure success if they are. This section provides guidance on industry roles, and 
discusses how companies could arrange for use of company field teams and emergency response centres as

possible means of carrying out their MRO responsibilities.
Early notification of potential or developing MROs is critical, due to the level of effort required to mount 
a very large-scale response. It is much better to begin the response process and abort it should it become 
unnecessary, than to begin it later than necessary should the actual need exist. Pilots and masters should be 
advised and trained to notify SAR services at the earliest indication of a potential distress situation.

Company response organizations should be able to help SAR services by organizing support, equipment, 
advice and liaison with any of their ships or aircraft.
Companies should be prepared to provide information to preclude the need for multiple sources attempting 
communications with the aircraft pilot in command or ship captain for information that is unavailable or available 
from another source. Receiving and handling requests for information aboard the distressed craft can interfere

with the pilot’s or master’s ability to handle the emergency and manage critical on-scene leadership needs.
Companies operating large aircraft or ships should be advised to prepare a coordinated team that can handle 
emergency response functions around the clock should the need arise. Such a team might include staff as 
indicated in the following table.

SAR authorities should coordinate MRO plans with companies that operate aircraft and ships designed to 
carry large numbers of persons. Such companies should share in preparations to minimize the chances that 
MROs will be needed, and to ensure success if they are. This section provides guidance on industry roles, and 
discusses how companies could arrange for use of company field teams and emergency response centres as

possible means of carrying out their MRO responsibilities.
Early notification of potential or developing MROs is critical, due to the level of effort required to mount 
a very large-scale response. It is much better to begin the response process and abort it should it become 
unnecessary, than to begin it later than necessary should the actual need exist. Pilots and masters should be 
advised and trained to notify SAR services at the earliest indication of a potential distress situation.

Company response organizations should be able to help SAR services by organizing support, equipment, 
advice and liaison with any of their ships or aircraft.
Companies should be prepared to provide information to preclude the need for multiple sources attempting 
communications with the aircraft pilot in command or ship captain for information that is unavailable or available 
from another source. Receiving and handling requests for information aboard the distressed craft can interfere

with the pilot’s or master’s ability to handle the emergency and manage critical on-scene leadership needs.
Companies operating large aircraft or ships should be advised to prepare a coordinated team that can handle 
emergency response functions around the clock should the need arise. Such a team might include staff as 
indicated in the following table.

Media 
representative
Gathers information, coordinates public affairs matters with counterparts in other 
organizations, prepares press releases, briefs spokespersons and arranges availability 
of information by phone and web sites
Specialists From within or outside the company who may facilitate some special aspect of the 
response or follow up
The company may operate an emergency response centre (ERC) to maintain communications with the craft

in distress, remotely monitor on-board sensors if feasible, and keep emergency information readily available. 
Such information might include passenger and crew data, aircraft or ship details, incident details, number 
of survival craft and status of the current situation. Transportation companies should have readily available 
contacts with tour companies, shore excursion companies, airlines and cruise lines, hotels, etc., since such

resources can be used to address many problems experienced with landing large numbers of survivors 
into a community. Contingency plans for cooperation should be developed between SAR authorities and 
transportation companies, and these plans should be sufficiently exercised to ensure they would be effective 
should an actual mass rescue situation arise. Such plans should identify contacts, coordination procedures,

responsibilities, and information sources that will be applicable for MROs. These plans should be kept up to 
date and readily available to all concerned.
Respective functions of the ERC and RCC should be covered in coordinated pre-established plans, and refined 
as appropriate for an actual incident. These centres must maintain close contact throughout the SAR event, 
coordinating and keeping each other appraised of significant plans and developments.

There are other steps the transportation industry could be urged to undertake to improve preparedness for 
MROs. The following are some examples:
 – carry SAR plans on board aircraft or ships;
 – provide water and thermal protection for evacuees appropriate for the operating area;
 – provide a means of rescue to bring people from the water to the deck of ships. (A means of rescue 
is a requirement for ro-ro passenger ships, and ships on international voyages are required to have

ship-specific plans and procedures for recovery of persons from the water.);
 – use preparation checklists provided by SAR authorities;
 – conduct an actual physical exercise in addition to simulations;
 – provide the capability to retrieve fully loaded lifeboats and rafts;
 – enhance lifeboat life-saving capabilities;
 – provide ways to assist persons in survival craft who are seasick, injured or weak;
 – provide on board helicopter landing or winching areas;

– prepare to assist survivors until and after they have been delivered to a place of safety;
 – have aircraft or ship status and specifications readily available, such as inspection records, design 
plans, communication capabilities, stability calculations, life-saving appliances, classification 
society contacts, passenger and cargo manifests, etc., so that such information will not need to be 
obtained directly from a pilot or master; and

obtained directly from a pilot or master; and
 – work with SAR authorities to develop and be able to rapidly deploy air droppable equipment or 
supplies for survivors, maintain strategically located caches for this purpose.
Acceptance of certain responsibilities by industry demonstrates commitment to passenger safety and can free 
SAR services to handle critical arrangements relating to SAR resources, coordination and communication.
MRO incident management

MRO incident management
For major incidents, crisis management for the overall response will also be needed. The Incident Command 
System (ICS), one widely used means of meeting this need, works best with some advance familiarization 
and exercising within and among the transportation and emergency response communities. Since SAR and 
transportation authorities are likely to encounter use of the ICS within emergency response communities, this

appendix provides general information for familiarization with ICS.
The following terms are relevant to the ICS:
 – incident commander (IC):  the primary person functioning as a part of the incident command 
system, usually at or near the scene, responsible for decisions, objectives, strategies and priorities 
relating to emergency response;
 – incident command post (ICP):  the location at which primary functions are carried out for the 
Incident Command System;

Incident Command System;
 – Incident Command System (ICS): and on-scene emergency management concept that provides an 
integrated organizational structure adaptable to the complexity and demands of a major incident 
involving multiple missions, response organizations or jurisdiction;
 – unified command (UC): the incident commander role of the incident command system expanded 
to include a team of representatives that manages a major incident by establishing common

objectives and strategies and cooperatively directing their implementation.
The ICS is designed for use when multiple organizations and jurisdictions need to be jointly involved in a 
coordinated emergency response activity.
While organizations have their respective systems of command and control or coordination, these should 
be compatible with systems in use by others so that organizations can function jointly and effectively

when necessary. Commonality and similarities among crisis management systems locally, regionally and 
internationally foster effective joint efforts.
The ICS does not take control, responsibility or authority away from SAR services; SAR services remain 
focused on life-saving, while the ICS focuses on promoting an effective overall incident response.
The ICS training, advance coordination and liaison will be rewarded by better performance and success when 
a crisis situation arises.

Appendix C – Mass rescue operations: exercises, industry roles and incident management

 – can easily expand or contract as the incident warrants;
 – relieves the SAR system of coordinating non-SAR missions;
 – enables SMCs to use the ICS contacts to draw on additional resources; and
 – ensures better communication and cooperation between agencies.
The ICS organization can grow or shrink as the situation dictates, and provides a logical process and

progression to achieve results. Its organization should be allowed to grow with increased demand and shrink 
when operations decline, both of which require anticipation.
Advantages of the ICS can be lost when organizations develop their own unique and relatively complex 
versions of the ICS; it works best when it remains simple, flexible and standardized so everyone on scene from 
all organizations understands it.

all organizations understands it.
In its basic form a person is designated as the IC to handle overall coordination, including setting objectives 
and priorities.
Support functions (sections supported by one or more persons) can be established as needed and on the scale 
needed to keep the IC informed and assist in certain areas.
The four support sections in the ICS organization are as follows:
 – operations section: helps manage resources to carry out the operations;

– planning section: helps develop action plans, collect and evaluate information, maintain resource 
status and arrange to scale up or scale down activities;
 – logistics section: helps provide resources and services needed to support the incident response, 
including personnel, transportation, supplies, facilities and equipment; and
 – finance-administration section:  assists with monitoring costs, providing accounting and

procurements, keeping time records, doing cost analysis and other administrative matters.
Other additions to directly assist the IC might include:
 – an information officer: assists the media and others seeking incident information, ensures the IC 
has appropriate information available, and helps to provide information to the public and families 
of persons in distress;
 – a safety officer:  monitors safety conditions and develops measures to ensure safety and reduce 
risks; and

risks; and
 – liaison officers:  serve as primary contacts for on-scene representatives of their respective 
organizations.

Figure C-1 – Incident Command System organization
The IC usually establishes an incident command post (ICP)  as a base for ICS activities. For particularly

demanding incidents, the ICS organization can be expanded. For example, for operations that are particularly 
large-scale, sustained or complex, the IC can be augmented by establishment of an actual or virtual (i.e. 
without everyone co-located) unified command (UC)  populated by operational managers representing the 
primary response organizations involved. If the UC is made up of linked independent command posts, a

Government post and an industry post for example, ideally there should still be a person from each command 
post assigned to work at the other post(s) involved.
For a situation like a major passenger aircraft or ship disaster, a joint information centre (JIC)  should be 
established, perhaps in association with the Information Officer position, to facilitate and coordinate the vast 
amount of information that will need to be managed internally and shared with the public.

Whether the ICS should be used depends on the duration and complexity of the incident. If it is used, 
coordination of SAR functions with other functions is usually achieved by assigning a representative of the SAR 
agency or of the SMC to the Operations Section of the ICS organization.
This allows SAR services to be plugged into the ICS and overall operations while still being able to function

with relative independence in accordance with normal SAR procedures. The ICS has an overall incident focus, 
while SAR services must remain focused on life-saving.
A determination should be made as early as possible regarding the person responsible for overall coordination, 
and how the overall response will be organized and managed. Procedures should be understood by all 
and overall response managed to ensure mutual support, effort prioritization, and optimal use of available

resources, and to enhance on-scene safety and effectiveness.
Interagency contingency planning should identify who the IC should be for various scenarios. Typically, the 
IC will be assigned from the Government organization with primary responsibility for the type of function 
most prominent in the response to the particular incident. However, with appropriate access to experts and 
information from all agencies concerned, a key consideration in selecting the IC should be familiarity and

experience with the IC function, i.e. the IC should be a person who can best handle the responsibility.
The IC should be someone skilled at managing on-scene operations and should usually be located at or near 
the scene. Everyone involved, regardless of rank or status, will normally be in a support role for the IC, similar 
to the SMC support structure within an RCC.
The IC function can be transferred as the situation warrants, although such transfers should be minimized

as is the case for transfers of SMC functions during a mission. It is important to designate an IC early, in 
contingency plans if possible, and to make a transfer later, as appropriate, as delay in designating an IC can 
be quite detrimental.
Except when functions other than SAR are relatively insignificant to the incident response, the IC should 
normally be someone other than the SMC. The priority mission will always be life-saving, and the SMC should

normally remain unencumbered by additional non-SAR duties.
Similarly, the IC’s command post should normally be at a location other than in the RCC, because the RCC 
needs to remain focused on, and be vigilant and responsive to, its normal SAR responsibilities in addition to 
handling SAR aspects of the major incident.
MRO communications in a maritime incident
Efficient communications in major maritime response incidents are best arranged by dividing communications

between several different frequencies. The number of frequencies used may vary, depending on the 
circumstances, but is unlikely to exceed five. The diagram below shows a major incident with numerous 
surface and air units responding and several different activities taking place on scene and, in support, ashore. 
The communications plan set up to deal with this incident is relatively simple so that all those responding may 
readily understand it. It needs to be established from the outset.

1  The primary coordinating frequency – initially VHF-FM channel 16 but a common working frequency 
may be assigned to ensure channel 16 is available for other distress alerts – is used by the casualty, the 
OSC, the ACO (if designated) and, if possible, the SMC. If the incident is out of the SMC’s VHF range, 
the SMC will communicate primarily with the OSC by satellite or MF or HF radio communications.

Other units on scene should monitor the primary coordinating frequency if possible, to be kept up to 
date by SITREPs, etc., but will not usually transmit on it.
2  Surface SAR units and other surface units such as ships responding to the distress alert will use a 
second frequency – usually VHF-FM channel 6 – controlled by the OSC.
3  Aircraft may also use this second frequency under the OSC’s control, if suitably equipped. An ACO

should be designated if responding aircraft are not equipped with marine VHF or in cases where it 
would be more efficient to control them separately (such as multiple aircraft on scene). The aircraft 
will then use a third frequency – usually VHF-AM 123.1MHz – controlled by the ACO. For further 
information on communications in multiple-aircraft cases, see chapter 7 , “Multiple aircraft SAR 
operations”, and appendix T.

operations”, and appendix T.
4  If other activities are taking place on scene, additional frequencies may be used for the necessary 
communications. If a helicopter, for example, needs to winch to or from a ship, these two units 
should switch to a mutually compatible frequency not already in use, returning to the main working 
frequencies after the winching operation is complete. Another example would be a search being

conducted as part of the overall SAR operation. In this case, the units assigned to the search will 
switch to a mutually compatible frequency controlled by a search coordinator. This coordinating unit 
reports to OSC or RCC, as appropriate.

5  In a major incident, such as an MRO, there will need to be significant exchange of information with 
authorities ashore: the operators of a ship or aircraft casualty, harbour and other receiving authorities, 
shoreside emergency services providing support, authorities and agencies concerned with counter-

pollution and salvage operations, and so on. These many organizations should communicate via 
the RCC, not directly with units on scene. This enables the SMC to maintain a clear overall picture 
of the response. Efficient procedures for this aspect of the communications plan can and should be 
pre-planned. The exchange of liaison officers is recommended.

Communications searches
Communications search for marine craft
1  All SAR facilities in the area should check radio log and records for any information.
2  Checks that give a thorough and rapid coverage of the area should be made, such as:
(a)  Bridge and lock tenders.
(b)  Local harbour patrols.
(c)  Marinas, yacht clubs, and other waterside facilities.
(d)  Dockmasters.
(e)  Harbour masters.

(d)  Dockmasters.
(e)  Harbour masters.
(f)  Local police (for boat launching ramps).
3  If the missing craft is known to have a radio aboard, RCCs should arrange for contact to be attempted. 
If a mobile device is known to be carried, attempt contact. Vessels, Ports, harbours, VTS, etc. in the 
areas of interest should be asked to check their logs for traffic to or from the craft and attempt to 
contact the craft regularly. Coast Radio Stations should be asked to attempt contact.

4 If persons are known or believed to have mobile devices, attempt to obtain information about these, 
and attempt contact. If anyone on board has a tracking and locating app, attempt to obtain information 
from the app, e.g. track history, current or last known position. 
5 The actual departure location and time should be confirmed. The craft’s non-arrival should also be 
confirmed and a request made that the RCC be notified immediately if it does arrive.

6 Each facility need be contacted only once during the search.
7 A report by SITREP to the SMC should be sent when the communications search is completed.
8 When a vessel is overdue from a long sea voyage, SAR authorities in other States may be requested 
to assist through their RCCs or through naval or other military channels.
If this search proves unsuccessful, further steps to be taken include:

1  During an extended communications search, facilities checked during first search should normally be 
rechecked at least every 24 hours, and preferably every 8 to 12 hours.
2 Additional facilities to be contacted during an extended search usually are left to the discretion of the 
unit conducting the communications search. However, a listing of these facilities should be provided 
to the RCC. An extended search should provide a thorough coverage of the area. Facilities and sources

of information may include:
(a)  Bridge and lock tenders.
(b)  Vessel/boat agents.
(c)  Local, county, and State police.
(d)  Police harbour patrols.
(e)  Harbour masters, port authorities.
(f)  Marinas, docks, yacht clubs.
(g)  Fish companies, fisherman associations.
(h)  Park service, forest rangers.
(i)  Fuel suppliers.
(j)  Ice houses.
(k)  Ship chandlers, repair yards.
(l)  Customs, immigration (if applicable).

Appendix D – Uncertainty phase data
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) D-3
(m)  Major tug companies (in large ports and rivers).
(n)  Relatives and neighbours.
3  All facilities and persons contacted during this phase should be asked to maintain a lookout for the 
search object during the course of their normal operations and to notify the nearest SAR unit if it is 
sighted. A definite time limit should be set so it will not be necessary to re-contact these numerous

sources to de-alert them after the vessel or boat has been located. If information is still desired after 
this period, another extended communications search should be started.
4  If the missing craft is radio equipped, stations conducting the communications search should attempt 
contact every four hours for 24 hours. If it is known that the vessel has the appropriate frequencies, 
the marine operator should be asked to call the vessel on the same schedule, and to watch for any

pertinent information received from other marine craft.
5  Local press, radio, and television coverage should be made during this phase for further dissemination 
of, and solicitation for, information on the missing craft.
6  Since numerous facilities must be checked during the search, it is not likely to be completed in a matter 
of hours, particularly if directed at night or on a weekend. It may be necessary to wait for normal

working hours to contact many sources. A listing must be maintained of the facilities contacted that 
will have to be rechecked. This will ensure a thorough search.
7  SAR facilities conducting an extended search should submit a SITREP as specified by the RCC. The 
SITREP should indicate the approximate percentage of the communications search completed.
8  A communications search is only as effective as the people making it. Because of this human factor,

the SMC should monitor the search as necessary to ensure that it is being conducted effectively.
Communications search for aircraft
1  Contact destination and alternate airports to confirm that aircraft has not arrived. Request physical 
ramp checks at all uncontrolled airports.
2  Contact departure airport to confirm actual departure, and non-return. Verify flight plan data, weather 
briefing received, and any other available facts.

briefing received, and any other available facts.
3  Request aircraft along or near route to attempt radio contact.
4  Contact ATS units, alert airfields, refuelling points, radar and DF stations within areas through which 
the aircraft may have flown.
5 If persons on board aircraft are known or believed to have mobile devices, attempt to obtain 
information about these, and attempt contact. If anyone on board has a tracking and locating app,

attempt to obtain information from the app (e.g. track history, current or last known position).
If these attempts are unsuccessful, further measures include:
1  Contact all airfields, aircraft carriers, and other ships as appropriate, aeronautical radio stations, 
operating agency’s radio stations, aeronautical aids to navigation stations, radar and DF stations within 
80 km (50 miles) of route and not checked during previous search.

2  Contact the other airfields in the general area where it is reasonably possible that aircraft may have 
landed.
3  Request aircraft along or near the intended route of flight to attempt contact and monitor appropriate 
frequencies for possible distress signals.
4  Contact other agencies, facilities, or persons capable of providing additional verifying information.

11 Assistance being received.
12 Other pertinent information.
When medical advice by a TMAS or a similar medical consultation service is not available to the RCC/SMC,

then the following medical consultation questions may be appropriate for the RCC/SMC to consider asking a 
doctor based on the information provided from the vessel:
1 What is the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and signs? ........................
The doctor is making a preliminary diagnosis on information which could be incomplete and may be 
inaccurate. However, this is the best information available and leads to the next questions.

2 What do they need, taking into account the medical competencies, equipment and medications on 
board the vessel?...............................................................
3 What medical care, intervention or procedure does the patient require to address the medical 
condition?....................................................................
This may include a specific doctor’s prescription for care on scene and en route to a medical facility.

4 Where can they get the required medical attention?.....................................
Which medical facilities have the required capability to meet the needs of the patient? If there are no  
specific or specialized medical requirements, then delivery is to the nearest hospital. This 
recommendation must also consider the responding craft (e.g. weather, fuel, endurance/range, etc.).
5 How soon do they need treatment?  ................................................

There may be a need for an immediate launch of a helicopter or vessel; or, a need to advise the vessel 
to divert towards a port with the appropriate medical facilities; or, maybe the MEDEVAC should wait 
for better weather, daylight hours, etc.
Based on the replies to the questions above, the doctor could then make one of three recommendations to 
the RCC/SMC: 
1 MEDEVAC recommended:
(a) with medical personnel/paramedics, as appropriate; or

(b) medical personnel/paramedics delivered to vessel (patient evacuation to be decided by medical 
personnel/paramedics); or
(c) by providing advice to the ship to divert towards a port with appropriate medical facilities.

Appendix D – Uncertainty phase data
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) D-7
2 MEDEVAC not recommended  – not deemed medically necessary (person can be treated on board or 
can await vessel’s arrival in port).
3 MEDEVAC not recommended at the time because it is assessed that transport would increase the risk 
to the patient. If possible, medical personnel/paramedic should be delivered to the vessel to provide 
further medical assistance.

Facilities and equipment selection
Selection of SAR facilities .......................................................  G-1
Supplies and survival equipment guide .............................................  G-9

Selection of SAR facilities
G.1  General
G.1.1  There are three broad categories of SAR facilities: aeronautical, maritime, and land. All three will be 
needed in most parts of the world, but local conditions determine their selection. Facilities selected by 
a SAR service need to be able to reach the scene of distress quickly and be suitable for the following 
types of operations:
 – providing assistance, e.g. escorting an aircraft or providing guidance on ditching, standing by a

ship sinking or on fire;
 – conducting a search;
 – delivering supplies and survival equipment; and
 – rescuing survivors and delivering them to a place of safety and proper medical care.
G.1.2 The range and speed of available search facilities should be considered when the search area is far 
from their home bases. They should be redeployed to an advance base closer to the scene so that 
more time will be available for the search and less time will be spent on transits to and from the search

area.
G.1.3 The number, placement, and training level of lookouts, their height above the ground or sea, fatigue, 
and the speed of the search craft are important factors affecting the probability of detection (POD) 
and probability of success (POS). Altitude is factored into sweep width determinations but the other 
factors, though important, usually are not included in order to keep the sweep width tables from

becoming much larger and more complicated. Search aircraft speed is especially important; slow 
aircraft flying at low altitudes generally have a significantly better chance of locating search objects 
visually. Lookout fatigue also can be an important factor, especially for long searches in rough weather.
G.2  Air facilities
G.2.1 Sources of aircraft suitable for SAR include:
 – Government department responsible for civil aviation;

– other Government or semi-government departments (e.g. police, fire services);
 – military services; and
 – commercial or private aircraft operators.
G.2.2 The following abbreviations may be used for aeronautical SAR facilities.

Long-range (radius of action of 1,390 km (750 NM) plus 2  1 _ 2   hours search remaining) LRG

  Note: The categories light, medium, and heavy refer to the load-carrying capabilities. Some military 
helicopters may have an air refuelling capability which extends their range. Hoist capability may also 
be included.
G.2.3 Aircraft are particularly suitable for any of the following functions in SAR tasks:
 Search   Aircraft are the most efficient search units because they can reach distant areas quickly and

cover a large area within a given time. Fixed-wing aircraft normally fly at higher speeds 
than helicopters and can therefore be used in larger areas and at greater range. Helicopters 
are excellent search aircraft, but their normally limited endurance and speed reduce the 
area they can search effectively. En-route aircraft may be able to give valuable assistance 
in locating survivors. They may be asked to keep a lookout or listening watch for signals

from survival beacons or other signalling devices, to report positions where they were 
first detected and, if possible, the position of greatest detected signal strength. Vessels and 
aircraft fitted with direction-finding (DF) equipment should be requested to report their 
own position and the DF bearing of the signals.
 Support   Aircraft may be used for delivering supplies, survival equipment, and SAR and medical

personnel at the distress scene, guiding other units on scene, and relaying communications.
 Rescue   Helicopters are a prime means for recovering survivors from a distress scene.
G.2.4 Many types of aircraft will be suitable for these tasks with little or no modification. However, even 
in an emergency, flight safety is the primary consideration. The SMC should be familiar with normal 
operational and technical limitations of an aircraft and crew. For instance, an aircraft without adequate

instrumentation or a pilot without an instrument rating should not undertake flights under instrument 
meteorological conditions.
G.2.5 SAR planners must consider the trade-off between aircraft speed and visual search effectiveness. 
Generally, the slower an aircraft flies, the better it is for conducting a visual search; small and partially 
hidden search objects are easily missed at higher speeds. The faster the aircraft flies, the greater the

area that can be covered. For fixed-wing aircraft, the maximum search speed should be no greater 
than 275 km/h (150 kts) unless the search object is very large. Normally, the slower the aircraft the 
lower the search height should be, to a minimum of 150 m (500 ft). Lower search heights should be at 
pilot discretion. Faster aircraft may have operational limitations making them unsuitable for low-level

flight. Nevertheless, fast or high-flying aircraft can play an important part in search operations, by 
carrying out:
.1 radio searches to home on distress signals transmitted from downed aircraft, vessels in distress, 
and ELTs and EPIRBs;
.2 exploratory sweeps of a large area, simultaneously with searches by slower aircraft flying at 
lower levels. This method is particularly effective over the sea or other flat and unobstructed 
areas; and

areas; and
.3 radio communication relays over areas of poor radio reception or beyond the range of coastal 
radio stations.

Appendix G – Facilities and equipment selection
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) G-3
G.2.6 The suitability and efficiency of an aircraft for search, support, and rescue operations will depend on 
the following features:
.1 operational characteristics:
 – safe, low speed and low-level flight capability;
 – short landing and take-off;
 – sufficient range to cover the area, with due regard to the location of redeployment bases;

– good manoeuvrability, especially for searches in mountainous areas; and
 – substantial payload capacity;
.2 equipment:
 – suitable navigation and instrument flying aids;
 – radio equipment capable of receiving and homing on emergency radio signals; and
 – adequate communications equipment for SAR purposes;
.3 availability of good observation posts, including some rear-looking;
.4 sensors for aiding in search object detection;

.4 sensors for aiding in search object detection;
.5 suitability for the delivery of supplies, emergency equipment, and personnel;
.6 air refuelling capability; and
.7 facilities for treatment and berthing of survivors.
G.2.7 Land-based fixed-wing aircraft can search and carry droppable supplies or parachute rescue personnel. 
Large aircraft must normally operate from prepared surfaces but many small aircraft can operate from

grass strips or frozen lakes or rivers. Where suitable landing grounds are near the distress scene, the 
landplane can accelerate the evacuation of survivors rescued by other means.
G.2.8 The seaplane is as useful as the landplane for carrying droppable supplies and personnel. Its use as 
a rescue plane or carrier of non-droppable supplies and personnel is generally limited to operations 
in lakes, rivers, sheltered waters, and bays. Under favourable weather and sea conditions, suitable

seaplanes could carry out rescue operations in protected waters, e.g. large lakes, but those on open 
water or at sea should be restricted to large seaplanes designed for rough-water work.
G.2.9 The amphibian combines the advantages of both landplane and seaplane. However, the weight 
penalty for carrying both a rugged hull and landing wheels reduces its range and restricts its water-
landing and take-off performance and its manoeuvrability on water.

G.2.10 Helicopters are the most versatile SAR aircraft because:
.1 their slow speed and ability to hover make them suitable for search as well as rescue operations, 
particularly where small search objects are sought or close scrutiny of terrain or sea is required; and
.2 their ability to land in a confined area and to operate from vessels enable them to rescue survivors 
from inaccessible places and rough seas long before surface units can arrive.

Helicopters should be equipped with rescue equipment for the evacuation of survivors, e.g. winching 
equipment, slings, baskets.
G.2.11  Small helicopters sometimes are only equipped for flight under visual meteorological conditions 
or, in some cases, during daylight. SAR helicopters should normally be instrumented for flight in 
instrument meteorological conditions and at night. Turbulence, gusty winds, or icing conditions may 
limit helicopter use.

Appendix G – Facilities and equipment selection
G-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
G.2.12  Providing a fixed-wing escort, also known as top cover, would improve safety and communications 
and may reduce SAR incident time for the helicopter. Top cover should be considered for a helicopter 
when it is operating in conditions such as at night, in remote areas, in extreme weather, or off the 
coast near its range limits.

coast near its range limits.
G.2.13  Due to the potential hazard of collision and the noise problem associated with helicopters operating 
in a confined space during rescue operations, it is essential that their operations be coordinated by the 
unit best suited for this function. This may be the RCC, OSC, or one of the helicopters or a fixed-wing 
aircraft. This unit should provide operating areas and altitudes for the helicopters and be responsive to

the requirements of surface rescue units whose operations may be hampered by helicopter noise and 
rotor wash.
G.2.14  Carrier-based aircraft can give the SAR system great flexibility because they have a well-equipped and 
mobile base. Furthermore, the aircraft carrier is well equipped to carry out rescue operations and to 
receive and care for survivors.
G.2.15  Equipment for aircraft participating in SAR operations includes:

Navigation equipment.    Accurate navigation is essential for maximizing the probability of 
success in search operations and for determining the exact position 
of survivors or wreckage. Since long- and medium-range aircraft may 
need to search far from their bases over isolated or ocean areas, 
extensive navigation equipment is essential. Precise navigation 
equipment such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) or GLONASS

can be helpful in covering a search area carefully or locating a datum, 
especially when operating over terrain or water with few navigation 
references. Short-range aircraft normally will not require extensive 
navigation equipment if used to search areas familiar to the pilot close 
to their bases. Aircraft tasked for SAR operations should be equipped 
to receive and home on radio signals, emergency locator transmitters 
(ELTs), emergency position-indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs), and if

practical, SAR radar transponders (SARTs).
 Communications equipment.   All aircraft should be equipped to maintain good communications 
with their RCC and RSC (either directly or indirectly) and other SAR 
facilities. SAR aircraft, particularly those engaged in oceanic searches, 
should be equipped to communicate with vessels or survival 
craft. They also should be able to communicate with survivors on 
VHF-FM channel 16 (156.8 MHz) and VHF-AM on 121.5 MHz and

123.1 MHz. SAR coordinators should consider the possible need for 
communications between aircraft and surface units within their SAR 
Regions, and ensure that this need can be met even for aircraft that 
cannot communicate directly on maritime frequencies. Typically, the 
RCC should be able to provide a communication link between the 
aircraft and surface units directly or by making other arrangements. 
SAR and government vessels should be encouraged to fit equipment

to be able to communicate directly on aeronautical frequencies. 
Passenger ships subject to the SOLAS Convention are required to 
have this capability.
  Auxiliary fuel tanks.    Where practicable, auxiliary fuel tanks should be available for SAR 
aircraft, to be readily fitted when increased range or endurance 
would benefit operations.
 Miscellaneous .      The following equipment, not normally carried by aircraft, should be 
readily available for SAR operations:
.1 binoculars;

.1 binoculars;
.2 a copy of the International Code of Signals;

Appendix G – Facilities and equipment selection
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) G-5
.3 signalling equipment, e.g. lamps, mounted loudspeakers, 
pyrotechnics;
.4 buoyant VHF/UHF marker beacons, floating lights, smoke 
floats, dye markers, etc., to mark position of survivors;
.5 air-deployable supplies and equipment for survivors;
.6 fire-fighting equipment;
.7 cameras for photographing wreckage and the location of 
survivors;
.8 first-aid supplies, including resuscitation equipment for

immediate use;
.9 loudhailers and containers for dropping written messages;
.10 portable dewatering pumps and bailers;
.11 inflatable liferafts; and
.12 lifejackets and lifebuoys.
G.3 Maritime facilities
G.3.1 Vessels suitable for oceanic SAR operations can be provided by:
.1 Government departments responsible for merchant and fishing vessel safety;
.2 military services;
.3 life-saving institutions;
.4 commercial shipping companies; and

.4 commercial shipping companies; and
.5 other public and private authorities, operators and owners of small vessels, e.g. police, customs 
and port authorities, fishing fleet and tugboat operators, pleasure boat owners, and oil companies 
with offshore installations.
G.3.2 Knowing the positions of merchant ships is often of considerable value in SAR operations. They are 
frequently the closest available means of search or rescue in a SAR incident on or over the high seas.

It is very important that RCCs fully use appropriate voice/data satellite communications services,  
GMDSS, CRS, VTS, and other means of communication described in chapter 2 of this volume to 
contact vessels in or near the search area to determine their locations and capabilities. Another, 
often faster and more efficient, means to obtain this information is via merchant vessel ship reporting 
systems. One such system is the Automated Mutual-assistance Vessel Rescue System (Amver).

Note: Amver is a global, voluntary merchant vessel reporting system open to ships of all flags. It is 
operated by the U.S. Coast Guard as a humanitarian service to promote safety of life at sea. By U.S. 
law and international agreement, Amver information may be used only for search and rescue purposes. 
Amver information is made available to any RCC in the world for use in responding to a search and

rescue incident. Amver information may be obtained by contacting any U.S. Coast Guard RCC. Amver 
may be used to determine positions, courses, speeds, and capabilities (including medical) of participating 
vessels within a specified radius about a point, within an area, or within some distance of a track line. 
Given a missing vessel’s international radio call sign, Amver can provide the vessel’s intended track,

projected position, and date and time of its last Amver report if it is an Amver participant.
G.3.3 The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea contains an obligatory provision for the 
master of a vessel to proceed with all speed to the assistance of persons in distress at sea. However, 
the master of a vessel is wholly responsible for the safety of his/her ship and therefore should be

requested (not directed) to undertake a specific action. The SMC should ensure that all pertinent 
information is given to any masters who are requested to divert their vessels to the scene of a distress.

Appendix G – Facilities and equipment selection
G-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
G.3.4 The following abbreviations may be used for maritime SAR facilities.
Category Abbreviation 
Rescue boat – short-range coastal and/or river craft RB
Rescue vessel – long-range seagoing craft RV
  Note: The boat and vessel speed in knots should be inserted, e.g. RB(14) or RV(10).
G.3.5 Vessels are usually suitable for both search and rescue operations at sea, particularly those which have

adequate speed, range, and seagoing qualities. The type of vessel assigned to an incident will depend 
upon the location of the distress scene, the number of survivors, the weather conditions, the speed, 
range and seagoing qualities required, and availability. Rescue vessels can sustain operations far from 
base. Warships, offshore lifeboats, seagoing tugs, customs and pilot launches, and patrol boats, are

most suitable on account of their special equipment and trained personnel. Agreements to secure the 
services of these vessels should be a priority.
G.3.6 Other potential SAR vessels include:
.1 icebreakers, which some States operate in colder climates for research purposes and to open 
navigation routes for other vessels;
.2 merchant vessels; their importance as a SAR facility is improved if they participate in a vessel 
reporting system; and

reporting system; and
.3 offshore oil rig supply vessels, fishing vessels, private yachts, and launches.
G.3.7 Rescue boats are short-range vessels, e.g. lifeboats, patrol boats and crash boats, which are capable 
of operating to a limited distance offshore. Pleasure craft, yachts, and inflatable boats fitted with an 
outboard engine also can be used for SAR, provided they carry appropriate equipment (see G.3.9).

G.3.8 Enough rescue boats should be available in areas with large numbers of pleasure craft and at 
aerodromes where the take-off or approach paths are over water so that they may go immediately to 
the scene of an accident. If boats of the type mentioned above are not available for rescue work from 
local owners or operators and owners, or if the area is distant from harbour or lifeboat station, special

rescue boats may have to be provided. Other vessels which could serve as rescue boats include:
.1 hydrofoils, capable of speeds in the range of 55 to 150 km/h (30 to 80 kts). They are best used 
in coastal or semi-sheltered water when fast response is desired; and
.2 hovercraft, which have a similar speed range to hydrofoils. Their amphibious capability and high 
speed make them ideal for rescue in ice-covered areas, swamps, and shallow or flat coastal

areas. Most can maintain a hover one to two metres off the surface and are unaffected by 
moderate seas, floating debris, or small obstructions.
G.3.9 Equipment for vessels participating in SAR operations includes:
 Navigation equipment.    Although larger vessels generally carry adequate navigation 
equipment, small craft may not. Owners of such craft assigned to 
SAR should be encouraged to install lightweight, easy-to-operate 
navigation equipment to enable them to reach a rendezvous or to

carry out a given search pattern accurately, without visual reference 
points.
  Communications .     The communications requirements for SAR vessels are generally 
the same as those for SAR aircraft. Good direct or indirect 
communications with the RCC, RSC, and other SAR units are 
essential. All SAR units must have radio communications to guard and 
communicate on the international distress frequency being used by 
the ship or other craft in distress. Radio equipment should be capable

of operating on MF/HF and VHF/UHF to communicate with the RCC

Appendix G – Facilities and equipment selection
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) G-7
and rescue units. SAR coordinators should consider the possible 
need for communications between aircraft and surface units within 
their SAR Regions, and ensure that this need can be met even for 
aircraft that cannot communicate directly on maritime frequencies. 
Typically, the RCC should be able to provide a communication link 
between the aircraft and surface units with their own equipment or

by making other arrangements. SAR and government vessels should 
be encouraged to fit equipment to be able to communicate directly 
on aeronautical frequencies. Passenger ships subject to the SOLAS 
Convention are required to have this capability. Chapter 2 discusses 
selection of radio frequencies.
  Miscellaneous equipment .   The equipment listed in G.2.12 and the following equipment should 
be carried aboard maritime SAR units. For smaller vessels or those

which only operate inshore this may not be practical, in which case 
the equipment should be readily available ashore. This equipment 
includes:
.1 life-saving and rescue equipment:
a) lifeboat with oars;
b) line-throwing apparatus, buoyant lifelines, and hauling 
lines;
c) non-sparking boat-hooks or grappling hooks and hatchets; 
and
d) rescue baskets, litters, boarding ladders, and/or scrambling 
nets;
.2 signalling equipment:
a) lamps, searchlights, and torches (flashlights);

b) flare pistol and colour-coded signal flares; and
c) buoyant VHF/UHF marker beacons, floating lights, smoke 
generators, flame and smoke floats, dye markers; 
.3 exposure suits for the crew.
G.4 Coastal facilities
G.4.1  Personnel and equipment for coastal SAR operations can be drawn from several sources:
.1 military and coastguard services;
.2 life-saving institutions; and
.3 police, fire departments, and other local authorities.

G.4.2 Facilities provided vary according to local prevailing conditions. They include:
.1 shelter huts equipped with emergency rations, means of communication, etc.;
.2 SAR teams provided with cliff rescue, breeches buoys, and similar equipment;
.3 first aid and medical teams; and
.4 accommodations for survivors.
G.5 Land facilities
G.5.1  Sources of personnel and equipment for land SAR operations include:
.1 military services (trained personnel, equipped and mobile);

Appendix G – Facilities and equipment selection
G-8 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
.2 police or fire departments (trained and equipped to search for, rescue, and transport missing and 
injured persons);
.3 public or commercial enterprises operating in the field or in remote areas and employing people 
and equipment capable of providing SAR assistance, e.g.
a) forestry departments;
b) transportation departments;
c) railway, telephone, telegraph, and hydro-electric companies;

d) disaster-response organizations;
e) engineering and road-building enterprises; and
f) health departments (medical stations);
.4 sports clubs and similar organizations specializing in activities useful to SAR, e.g. parachute 
jumping, diving, scouting, hiking, mountain climbing, cave spelunking, skiing, or potholing; and
.5 specialized international teams, e.g. search dogs and collapsed structure task forces.

G.5.2 Land facilities, unlike air and marine facilities, are difficult to classify. However, abbreviations for five 
specialist facilities, parachute rescue unit (PRU), mountain rescue unit (MRU), urban search and rescue 
(USAR), cave rescue unit (CRU), and desert rescue unit (DRU), may be used. USAR teams specialize 
in rescue of survivors from collapsed structures.
G.5.3 Search by land facilities alone is usually impractical for large areas but they can be used in most

weather conditions and can provide complete coverage of the area searched. They are mainly used 
when a confined area cannot be thoroughly searched from the air, and in operations where the search 
is carried out by aircraft and the rescue is performed by land facilities.
G.5.4 Land rescue facilities need highly mobile vehicles in order to reach an accident site quickly and initiate 
rescue action. For road transport, the land facility will normally use vehicles at its disposal, such as

ambulances, four-wheel-drive vehicles, trucks, buses, or cars belonging to its members. Military units 
can usually provide rough-terrain vehicles, such as high traction vehicles and troop-carriers. In areas 
where motor transport is unsuitable, transport by horses, mules, dog-sleds, canoe, boats, or on foot 
may be required.
G.5.5 Equipment for land facilities includes:
 Navigation equipment.    The navigation equipment needed by land facilities need not be

elaborate, but at least the following should be carried by each 
member or team:
.1 large-scale maps (1:50000 or 1:100000);
.2 reliable magnetic compass and watch; and
.3 a protractor and a pair of dividers.
           DF equipment for radio signals, listening devices for collapsed 
structures, and GPS equipment for three-dimensional positioning 
can be useful.
 Communications.      Each land facility should be able to communicate with the RCC,

either directly or through its base camp. In combined air/surface 
operations the land facility must be able to communicate with the 
SAR aircraft. Portable lightweight radio equipment is available for 
this purpose. The selection of appropriate radio frequencies for the 
different communications functions is dealt with in chapter 2.
 Personal equipment.    Each member of a land SAR facility should be properly clothed and 
equipped for the mission. This may include rations for two or three

days to reduce the need for air-drops, and sufficient personal medical 
supplies. If not part of the permanent equipment carried by the land 
facility, the following should be readily available:
.1 binoculars;
.2 signalling equipment, e.g. loudhailers, pyrotechnics, whistles;
.3 non-sparking tools;
.4 cameras;
.5 supplies and survival equipment as required;
.6 portable lights operated from vehicle batteries and flashlights 
and spare batteries to be carried by each team member; and

.7 fire-fighting equipment.
G.5.6 Proper equipment is particularly important for those facilities which require additional gear for 
specialist work, such as:
.1 special equipment for a PRU, in addition to parachutes, will vary according to the nature of the 
terrain in which it will operate, i.e.:
a) crash helmets fitted with protective visor;
b) protective suits of tough material;
c) stout boots; and
d) ropes or other devices for climbing down from trees;

.2 special equipment for an MRU will include mountain-climbing gear such as ropes, slings, ice 
axes, and crampons;
.3 special equipment for USAR teams will include dogs and electronic locating equipment, 
equipment suitable for cutting and removing various types of structural material and debris;
.4 special equipment for CRUs includes climbing equipment, lights, litters, and helmets; and
.5 special equipment for a DRU will include:
a) sunshades and extra drinking water;

a) sunshades and extra drinking water;
b) four-wheel-drive winch-fitted vehicle;
c) sand shovel; and
d) mats, boards, and other material to ensure that the vehicle does not get stuck.

Report and alarm
Explanation  
 
The first step in activating an incident response organization is to acknowledge a reported incident and alert 
the emergency services. A report has to be converted rapidly into an effective alert if emergency assistance 
is to arrive quickly. To do that, a fixed structure must be observed for processing reports and alerting units.

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) H-11
RCC response, response time and communications
1.1.1 Standard
The RCC receives a report. The contents of the report must be clarified quickly (three minutes). In order to 
make a report complete as quickly as possible, questions must be asked briefly and to the point, professionally 
and assertively. The information ascertained is then used to create an alert and, as a part thereof, an initial

deployment. To check this, listen to the recorded audio material from the incident.

1.1.4 Recommendation(s)
Incident records
1.1.5 Standard
Records of the incident need to be kept as stipulated. The information included also needs to be complete. 
A layperson should be able to follow and understand the incident on the basis of the records kept. Essential 
information is marked.

Scale up/Scale down  
Explanation
An incident response organization can scale up or scale down depending on several factors, which are:
• The severity of the incident.
• The extent of the incident.
• The location of the incident.
• The seriousness of the situation for external organizations.
Ultimately, in the event of scaling up it must be ensured that a suitable number and suitable standard of people 
and resources are deployed.

and resources are deployed.
Estimation of severity of incident
1.1.9 Standard
The information available must be fully used and interpreted at all times. A picture of the incident should be 
built up as soon as possible and a worst-case scenario should be assumed. If the severity was underestimated, 
how did this happen?

Leadership and coordination
Explanation
Some of the aspects relating to leadership and coordination include: setting priorities in mutual consultation 
in dealing with the incident (the decision-making process), but also coordinating and leading the actual

response workers or the response procedures themselves. The results of this should be monitored in order 
that assessment and adjustment be possible.
Leadership
1.1.13 Standard
The watch manager should lead his team. As events occur, he/she should clearly take the lead. People work 
together as a team and share information with each other directly. All this is in line with the training.
1.1.14 Assessment
1.1.15 Sub-conclusion
1.1.16 Recommendation(s)
Coordination by the RCC
1.1.17 Standard

Coordination by the RCC
1.1.17 Standard
The RCC should provide strong leadership for the deployed emergency services and ensure there is coordination 
between the parties. The RCC therefore needs to have an accurate picture of the situation at all times. Also ask 
the deployed emergency services how they experienced the RCC’s role.

1.1.20 Recommendation(s)
Information management
Explanation

Information management
Explanation
Information management is both a technical and organizational process. The more quickly and more 
comprehensively information becomes available, structured incident response options increase accordingly.
Sharing information
1.1.21 Standard
Information needs to be available in the right format and at the right time for the people who need it. They 
include the deployed units and the RCC itself.

Situation report formats and examples
Situation reports (SITREPs) are used to pass information about a particular SAR incident. RCCs use them to keep 
other RCCs, RSCs, and appropriate agencies informed of cases which are of immediate or potential interest or 
as a briefing tool where an RCC is requesting assistance or action(s) from another RCC or organization. The 
OSC uses SITREPs to keep the SMC aware of mission events. Search facilities use SITREPs to keep the OSC

informed of mission progress. The OSC addresses SITREPs only to the SMC unless otherwise directed. The 
SMC may address SITREPs to as many agencies as necessary, including other RCCs and RSCs, to keep them 
informed. SITREPs prepared by an SMC usually include a summary of information received from OSCs. Often 
a short SITREP is used to provide the earliest notice of a casualty or to pass urgent details when requesting

assistance. A more complete SITREP is used to pass amplifying information during SAR operations. Initial 
SITREPs should be transmitted as soon as some details of an incident become clear and should not be delayed 
unnecessarily for confirmation of all details.
For SAR incidents where pollution or threat of pollution exists as a result of a casualty, the appropriate agency 
tasked with environmental protection should be an information addressee on SITREPs.
International SITREP format

International SITREP format
A SITREP format has been adopted internationally which is intended for use for international communications

Alternate SITREP format
Another SITREP format, in common use in certain SAR regions, is presented below. This format uses four 
main paragraphs and a subject line to convey all essential information.
Identification    (The subject line contains the phase of the emergency, SITREP number, a one- or two-word 
description of the emergency, and identification of the unit sending the SITREP . SITREPs are

numbered sequentially throughout the entire case. When an OSC is relieved on scene, the 
new OSC continues the SITREP numbering sequence.)
Situation     (A description of the case, the conditions that affect the case, and any amplifying information 
that will clarify the problem. After the first SITREP , only changes to the original reported 
situation need be included.)
Action taken    (A report of all action taken since the last report, including results of such action. When

an unsuccessful search has been conducted, the report includes the areas searched, a 
measure of effort such as sorties flown and hours searched, and the track spacing actually 
achieved.)
Future plans    (A description of actions planned for future execution, including any recommendations 
and, if necessary, a request for additional assistance.)
Status of case   (This is used only on the final SITREP to indicate that the case is closed or that search is

suspended pending further developments.)

Appendix J
Intercepts
J.1 Types of intercepts
J.1.1  This appendix provides methods for solving most SAR intercept problems. Intercepts are needed 
when a distressed craft is still able to move toward a safe haven but there is substantial concern as to 
whether it will be able to reach safety before it suffers a catastrophic incident. SAR intercepts fall into 
two broad categories.

two broad categories.
(a)  Direct intercepts are those where the SAR facility intercepts the distressed craft at some point 
and then provides assistance, such as rescuing survivors, performing a medical evacuation, 
escorting the distressed craft to safety, etc. Three types of direct intercept are possible. They 
are the head-on, overtaking, and offset or beam-on intercepts. For direct intercepts, it is usually

assumed that the SAR facility’s speed is greater than that of the distressed craft.
(b)  Minimum time-to-scene intercepts (MTTSI) are used when the SAR facility’s speed is less than 
that of the distressed craft. The objective of MTTSI is to launch a SAR facility and have it follow 
a path that will keep it in the best position relative to the distressed craft so that its transit time to 
the scene of any ensuing catastrophe (e.g. an aircraft ditching) will be minimized. An example of

this situation is when a helicopter is dispatched toward an incoming fixed-wing aircraft that has 
declared an in-flight emergency. This type of intercept has also been called a “maximum SAR 
coverage intercept”.
J.1.2 The intercept procedures in this appendix may be used for either vessels or aircraft. Some of the 
examples and figures depict vessel intercepts and some depict aircraft intercepts. It should be noted

that the higher speed of aircraft often requires more rapid calculation of the intercept course and speed. 
Intercept planners should also be aware that winds aloft may affect aircraft intercept calculations and 
water currents may affect vessel intercept calculations.
J.2 Head-on method
J.2.1 This method is used when the distressed craft is moving directly toward the SAR facility’s position. The

instructions which follow refer to figure J-1. To establish the intercept course and time and position 
where the intercept will be made, proceed as follows:
(a) Plot the relative positions of both the distressed craft (A) and the intercepting SAR facility (B) for 
that time at which the intercepting SAR facility is ready to proceed.
(b) Join the two positions with a line (AB). This line is the course made good of the distressed craft

and its reciprocal is the course made good of the intercepting SAR facility.
(c) Lay off a line 90° to the distressed craft’s course made good and project it a reasonable distance 
(AC).
(d) Along this line, measure off the distance it will cover in one hour, based on the speed it is 
making good, and mark the position with an X.
(e) Lay off a line 90° to the intercepting SAR facility’s course made good on the opposite side of AB 
and project it a reasonable distance (BD).

(f) Along this line, measure off the distance the intercepting SAR facility will cover in one hour, 
based on the speed it can make good along its intended course, and mark the position with a Y.
(g) Join the positions X and Y with a line. Where it cuts the course line is the intercept position, P .
(h) To find the time for this intercept, measure the distance from the initial position of either craft to

the position of intercept and divide this distance by the speed of the chosen craft.

J.3.1 This method is used when the distressed craft is moving directly away from the SAR facility’s position. 
The instructions which follow refer to figure J-2. To establish the intercept course, and the time and

position where the intercept will be made, proceed as follows:
(a) Plot the relative positions of both the distressed craft (A) and the intercepting craft (B) for that 
time at which the intercepting SAR facility is ready to proceed.
(b) Join the two positions with a line and project it a reasonable distance (BC). This line is the course

(d) Along this line, measure off the distance the intercepting SAR facility will cover in one hour,

the same side as BD.
(f) Along this line, measure off the distance the distressed craft will cover in one hour, based on the 
speed it is making good, and mark the position with a Y.

(g) Join the positions X and Y with a line and project it until it cuts the course line at F. This is the 
intercept position.
(h) To find the time for the intercept, measure the distance from the initial position of either craft to 
the position of the intercept, and divide this distance by the speed of the chosen craft.

J.4 Offset or beam-on intercept: method 1 (no wind/current effects)
J.4.1 This method is used when the distressed craft is not moving directly toward or away from the SAR 
facility’s position and the effects of winds aloft (for aircraft) or currents (for vessels) are not significant. 
When the distressed craft has the greater ground speed (GS), the SAR facility will have to be closest

to the intended destination to make the offset interception possible. (Another technique that is often 
useful when the SAR facility is slower than the distressed craft is the minimum time-to-scene intercept 
(MTTSI) described in paragraph J.7 .) The instructions which follow refer to figure J-3. To establish the 
intercept course, time of intercept, and position where the intercept will be made, proceed as follows:

(a) Plot the relative positions of both the distressed craft (A) and the intercepting SAR facility (B) for 
that time at which the intercepting SAR facility is ready to proceed.
(b) Join these two positions with a line (AB).
(c) Lay off the distressed craft’s track in the direction of its heading and project it a reasonable 
distance on the chart (AC).
(d) Along this projected track or course line of the distressed craft, measure off the distance it will

cover in one hour, based on its speed through the air (TAS for aircraft) or water (vessels), and 
mark the position with an X.
(e) Transfer the line joining the two craft through the plotted position, X (XY).
(f) With the centre of the circle being the point of departure of the intercepting SAR facility and 
using a radius equal to the distance it will cover in the time interval used for the distressed craft, 
describe an arc and mark the spot where the arc cuts the transferred line (W).

Note: If the speed of the intercepted or intercepting vessel is such that the scale of the chart 
makes it unreasonable to use a full hour, then it will be necessary to use a proportional interval 
of time to ensure that the radius of the arc cuts the transferred line.
(g) Draw a line from the position of the intercepting SAR facility through the spot where the arc cuts 
the transferred line — this is the intercept heading/course for the intercepting SAR facility. By

projecting this line until it cuts the projected track or course line of the distressed craft, one finds 
the position where the intercept will take place (D).
(h) To find the time it will take for the intercept, measure the distance from the initial position of 
the intercepting vessel to the point of intercept and divide this distance by the speed of the 
intercepting vessel (BD).

J.5 Offset or beam-on intercept: method 2 (with wind/current effects)
J.5.1 This method is used when the distressed craft is making good a known track at a known speed over 
the ground, the SAR facility is to one side of the track, and winds aloft (for aircraft) or currents (for 
vessels) are significant. When the distressed craft has the greater ground speed (GS), the SAR facility

will have to be closest to the intended destination to make the offset interception possible. (Another 
technique that is often useful when the SAR facility is slower than the distressed craft is the minimum 
time-to-scene intercept (MTTSI) described in paragraph J.7 .) To perform an offset interception (refer to 
figure J-4):
(a) Plot the simultaneous positions of the distressed aircraft (A) and the SAR aircraft (B). Along the

course being made good by the distressed craft, plot its projected positions for ten minutes (C) 
and one hour and ten minutes (D) later. The ten-minute lead to the position of the distressed craft 
is allowed for navigational errors. Be certain to use speed (in knots) and course made good over 
the ground to plot these dead reckoning (DR) positions.
(b) Draw a line of constant bearing (LCB) between positions B and C.
(c) Draw a second LCB, parallel to BC, through point D.

(d) For aircraft, draw a wind vector downwind from the original position of the SAR facility (BF) 
which is equal to the average expected winds aloft. For vessels, draw a current vector in the 
down-current direction which is equal to the expected average currents.
(e) Draw an arc equal to the SAR facility’s speed (TAS for aircraft, speed through the water for 
vessels) through the second LCB using the end of the wind/current vector (F) as the centre of

origin. Then draw a line between the origin (F) and the point where the SAR facility’s speed arc 
crosses the second LCB (G). This represents the heading to be used by the SAR facility.
(f) The line drawn from the original position of the SAR aircraft (B) to point G represents the 
intercepting SAR facility’s true course and speed made good over the ground. If necessary, this 
line is extended until it crosses the projected true course of the distressed craft (H).

(g) The distance to intercept the intended track of the distressed craft is measured between the 
original position of the SAR facility (B) and the point at which the interception course made good 
crosses the projected course made good of the distressed craft (H). The en-route time for this 
distance and closure time for the lead distance are computed and added to determine total time 
required for a collision point intercept with the distressed aircraft.

(h) Depending on the speed differential, the SAR facility may execute a turn to the reciprocal of 
the track of the distressed craft when the course of the distressed craft has been intercepted. 
Interception of the course of the distressed aircraft can be confirmed by direction finding (DF) 
from the distressed craft.

J.6 Offset or beam-on intercept: method 3 (using a direction finder)
J.6.1 This procedure requires that the SAR aircraft have DF equipment that can receive transmissions from 
the distressed aircraft, and is executed as follows (refer to figure J-5), using magnetic (MAG) bearings:
(a) After the bearing to the distressed aircraft has been determined, the SAR aircraft is turned to a

heading 45° from this bearing in the direction the distressed aircraft is flying.
(b) A relative bearing of 45° is maintained by checking DF bearings.
(c) If the DF check reveals that the bearing from the SAR aircraft has increased, the interception 
course should be increased twice the amount of the change between the last two bearings.
(d) If the check reveals that the bearing from the SAR aircraft has decreased, the interception course

should be decreased twice the amount of change between the last two bearings.
(e) By bracketing the bearings as described above, an interception course is determined by 
maintaining a line of constant bearing.

J.7 Minimum time-to-scene intercept (MTTSI)
 Introduction

Introduction
J.7.1 When an aircraft declares an in-flight emergency, it is often prudent for search and rescue (SAR) 
resources to respond even though the distressed aircraft may be able to reach its destination. The 
purpose of such a response is to minimize the time required to get a search and rescue unit (SRU) 
to the scene in the event of a ditching, forced landing, or bailout. Ideally, the SRU would intercept

the distressed aircraft and then escort it to its destination. However, this is not always possible. 
SRUs, especially helicopters, often cannot fly as fast as the distressed aircraft and have a limited 
endurance and operating distance. When this situation arises, it is necessary to determine when 
the SRU should be launched toward the distressed aircraft and when it should turn back toward the

distressed aircraft’s destination so the SRU’s transit time to the scene of any ensuing SAR incident is 
minimized. This is accomplished by having the SRU fly toward the distressed aircraft, turn around 
before it intercepts the distressed aircraft, and then allow the distressed aircraft to overtake it as both 
fly toward the destination. Adding complexity to the problem is the fact that the SRU’s ground speed

on the outbound leg may be significantly different from its ground speed on the inbound leg due to 
the effects of winds aloft. During the intercept, the distressed aircraft should be constantly informed 
of the type and the status of the interception being performed.
 Assumptions
J.7. 2 The three formulas below are based on the following assumptions:
(a) The SRU will depart from and return to the aerodrome that is the distressed aircraft’s destination.

Appendix J – Intercepts
J-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(b) The time it takes the SRU to get to the distressed aircraft’s position (time to scene) anytime 
after the SRU makes its turn will be minimized, on average, when the time to scene at the end 
of the SRU’s outbound leg equals the difference in the arrival times of the two aircraft at the 
destination aerodrome. An intercept procedure where this is true is called a minimum time-to-
scene intercept (MTTSI).

scene intercept (MTTSI).
(c) The distressed aircraft is not expected to be in immediate danger of ditching, crash landing, or 
bailout before it reaches the SRU’s maximum operating distance.
(d) The ground speeds of the SRU on the outbound and inbound legs and the ground speed of the 
distressed aircraft are all known and remain constant throughout the mission.
(e) The distressed aircraft’s ground speed will be greater than that of the SAR aircraft on the inbound 
leg.

leg.
(f) The position of the distressed aircraft is accurately known and it is proceeding from that location 
directly to the destination aerodrome.
 SRU maximum operating distance
J.7. 3 The maximum operational endurance of the SRU is an important factor in determining how far it may 
go from the aerodrome and still have enough fuel to provide some assistance to survivors and return 
safely. Maximum operational endurance is defined as the maximum endurance of the SRU minus the

sum of the minimum useful time on scene and the required fuel reserve. For example, a helicopter 
might have a maximum endurance of 4+30 (four hours, thirty minutes). If the minimum useful time at 
the scene is 10 min and a 20 min fuel reserve is required, then its maximum operational endurance is 
4+00 or exactly four hours. To compute the maximum operating distance, the following formula may 
be used:
[1]  Dmo =   
( T mo   V a1 V a2 )
 _________  V a1 + V a2     
 where:

_________  V a1 + V a2     
 where:
 D mo = The SRU’s maximum operating distance in nautical miles,
 T mo  = The SRU’s maximum operational endurance in hours,
 V a1  = The SRU’s ground speed on the outbound leg in knots, and
 V a2 = The SRU’s ground speed on the inbound leg in knots.
 For example, if the helicopter mentioned above cruises at 150 knots true air speed (TAS) and there is 
a 25 knot wind at the helicopter’s flight level blowing toward the distressed aircraft, then the SRU’s

ground speeds will be 175 knots on the outbound leg and 125 knots on the inbound leg. Using these 
values in formula [1], a maximum operating distance of about 292 NM is computed.
    4 × 175 × 125  ____________  175 + 125   = 291.67}
 Time to launch the SRU
J.7.4 If the distressed aircraft is beyond the SRU’s maximum operating distance when the emergency is 
declared, the time to launch the SRU may be computed using the following formula:
[2]  T0 =  [   D __ Vb
   – Dmo

[2]  T0 =  [   D __ Vb
   – Dmo   
 V   a1  2   + 2 V a1  +  V a2  V b 
  ______________   V a1   V b ( V a1  +  V a2 )   ] 
 where:
 T 0 = The time to launch in minutes after the emergency was declared,
 D  =  The distance, in nautical miles, of the distressed aircraft from the aerodrome when the 
emergency was declared,
 V b = The ground speed of the distressed aircraft in knots.

Appendix J – Intercepts
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) J-7
 For example, consider a scenario where the distressed aircraft declares an emergency when it is 
600 miles from its destination while maintaining a ground speed of 200 knots, and the SRU is the 
same helicopter used in the above examples. Using these values in formula [2], it will be found that 
the helicopter should not be launched until about 14 min after the emergency was declared.

60  [    600 ____ 200   – 291.67     175 2  + (2 × 175 + 125) + (125 × 200)    ____________________________   175 × 200 × (175 + 125)     ]  = 14.375
 Note: If formula [2] produces a negative value for T0, it means the distressed aircraft is already close 
enough for the SRU to be launched immediately.
 Note: If it is feared that the distressed aircraft is likely to experience a ditching, forced landing, or

bailout situation as soon as it is within the SRU’s maximum operating distance or shortly thereafter, 
then a direct intercept at the SRU’s maximum operating distance should be considered. The risk 
associated with this tactic is that of substantially increasing the SRU’s time to scene if the distressed 
aircraft stays aloft longer than expected. If a second SRU is available, this risk can be eliminated by

having it perform a MTTSI intercept in addition to the direct intercept performed by the first SRU.
 Time to turn
J.7. 5 Once the distressed aircraft’s distance from the aerodrome at the time the SRU is launched is known, 
it is possible to compute how long the SRU should fly before turning back toward the aerodrome. The 
formula for this computation is
[3]  Ta1 =   
60 D 0  V a2 ( V a1  +  V b )
  ______________________   
 V b  (  V  a1   2   +  ( 2 V a1  V a2  )  +  (  V a2  V b  )  )

where:
 T a1 =  The time in minutes after launch when the SRU should turn back toward the aerodrome, 
and
 D 0 =  The distressed aircraft’s distance, in nautical miles, from the aerodrome at the time the 
SRU was launched.
 For example, using the same ground speeds as in the previous examples and assuming the distressed 
aircraft is 500 NM from the aerodrome when the SRU is launched, using formula [3] produces a time 
to turn of about 71 min after launch.

to turn of about 71 min after launch.
    60 × 500 × 125 × (175 + 200)    __________________________________     
200 ×  (  175 2  + (2 × 175 × 125) + (125 × 200) ) 
     = 70.75
 Note: In any intercept situation, the SAR Mission Coordinator (SMC) should consider other facilities 
to supplement the capabilities of the intercepting SRU. For example, if the intercept is over the ocean, 
requesting a list of merchant vessels near the distressed aircraft’s intended track from Amver should

be considered. If time and circumstances permit, the pilot of the distressed aircraft should be provided 
such information in case a ditching becomes necessary.

Guidance for establishing probable survivor location
K.1 General
K.1.1 As soon as it is known or suspected that a distress incident has occurred, the SMC must first determine 
the time and location of the distress as accurately as possible. Sometimes a complete and accurate 
time and position are given with the initial report. Often, however, only partial information or a few 
clues are available from which to estimate the time and place of the distress incident.

K.1.2 Whenever a craft is missing and believed to be in distress, the SMC should make every effort to obtain 
additional information and clues which, when analysed, will reduce the size of the area most likely to 
contain the survivors and point to a small area that has a high probability of containment (POC) value. 
Additional information and clues may include any information received from the distressed craft prior

to the distress incident or observations by other persons which might be related to the distressed craft 
or the conditions that led to the distress incident. The effort to obtain more information and clues 
should continue until all the survivors have been located or otherwise accounted for.
K.1.3 The following sections describe how to estimate the time and location of the distress incident in a few

of the more common SAR situations. SMCs should note that the specific scenarios discussed below 
are only a small sample of the possible situations which may be encountered. Many of the techniques 
described below may be adapted to other situations not covered here.
K.2 Estimating distress incident time and location
 Complete time and position reported
K.2.1 When apparently complete and accurate time and position information about a distress incident

are provided, the SMC should immediately plot the position and check for any obvious errors. If the 
position is not obviously inconsistent with other known information, the SMC should immediately 
contact and dispatch the most suitable available facilities. As soon as this has been done, steps 
should be taken to verify the position and reduce its uncertainty. The uncertainty in the reported 
position will depend upon the method(s) used to determine it. Appendix N contains guidance for

estimating probable position errors. If there is continued contact with the distressed craft, its crew 
should be asked to report any visible landmarks or other information from a second source, such as 
an alternative means of navigation, to confirm the craft’s location. If this is not possible, then a more 
careful comparison of the reported position with all other known information that might be pertinent

should be done. For example, if the initial report was from a vessel sinking in a storm, the position 
should be compared with the latest available weather information for the reported time and location 
of the distress. Any inconsistencies which are found must be resolved as quickly as possible.
 Time of distress is known, but position is not known
K.2.2 If an en-route aircraft or vessel reports a distress without indicating its location, several situations are

possible. The following scenarios are just a few of the possibilities that may be considered.
(a) The craft was following its intended flight or voyage plan at the time of the distress incident. 
In this situation, the approximate position may be estimated based on data from the flight or 
voyage plan and any previous position reports along the intended track that may be available. 
(If previous position reports do not fall on or near the intended track, another scenario should

be considered.) The estimated distress position should be based on the last known or reported 
position, the estimated or intended speed of advance, and the craft’s intended track. If there is 
no conflicting information, this scenario is usually considered the most likely.
(b) The craft significantly altered its intended course or speed of advance as a result of encountering 
adverse weather conditions, winds aloft, etc. The SMC should obtain appropriate information

In this situation, the approximate position may be estimated based on data from the flight or 
voyage plan and any previous position reports along the intended track that may be available. 
(If previous position reports do not fall on or near the intended track, another scenario should 
be considered.) The estimated distress position should be based on the last known or reported 
position, the estimated or intended speed of advance, and the craft’s intended track. If there is

no conflicting information, this scenario is usually considered the most likely.
(b) The craft significantly altered its intended course or speed of advance as a result of encountering 
adverse weather conditions, winds aloft, etc. The SMC should obtain appropriate information

Appendix K – Determining datum
K-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
about weather conditions along the craft’s intended route and attempt to correlate that information 
with the distress incident. The SMC should then attempt to determine the course(s) of action 
the master or pilot in command would be most likely to take if those weather conditions were 
encountered. The estimated position of the distress incident should be based on this information.

(c) The craft significantly altered its intended course or speed of advance to avoid encountering 
adverse weather conditions. The SMC should obtain appropriate information about weather 
conditions along the craft’s intended route and attempt to correlate that information with the 
distress incident. The SMC should then attempt to determine the course(s) of action the master 
or pilot in command would be most likely to take to avoid those weather conditions.

(d) The craft significantly altered its intended course or speed of advance in an attempt to reach the 
nearest safe port or alternate aerodrome. This includes the possibility of the craft reversing its 
direction in an attempt to return to its departure point.
K.2.3 To estimate the extent of the possibility area which includes all possible scenarios, perform the 
following steps:
(a) using the guidance provided in appendix N, or other more accurate information if it is available,

estimate the probable error in the last known or reported position;
(b) estimate the maximum distance the distressed craft could have travelled between the time of its 
last known or reported position and the time of the distress incident;
(c) add the probable error in the last known or reported position to the maximum distance the craft 
could have travelled and draw a circle of that radius about the last known or reported position 
to determine the possibility area.

to determine the possibility area.
K.2.4 Often the possibility area encompassing all scenarios is too large to search effectively. Whenever 
several scenarios are possible, and especially when they are about equally likely, the SMC should 
make every effort to obtain additional information that will eliminate some of the scenarios from 
consideration and allow refinement of the remaining ones to reduce the size of the possibility area.

For example, if a short-range radio was used to transmit the distress signal, determining which stations 
heard the signal can help reduce the range of possible locations. If a DF bearing was obtained for the 
distress signal, a line of bearing for the distress position or mobile telecommunications device data 
which may help indicate present or past location or area can be established which may eliminate

some scenarios. The goal is to eliminate and adjust scenarios until a single scenario emerges which 
accounts for all the known facts. However, this is not always possible and it may be necessary to 
choose a specific scenario on which to base the search plan.
K.2.5 For search planning purposes, the estimated area where the distress may have occurred depends on 
which scenario is most likely to be true. For the scenario described in paragraph K.2.2 (a) above, the

datum position and probable error of position are determined as follows:
(a) Determine the distressed craft’s last known or reported position and the means used to establish 
that position, such as a navigational fix and the method of navigation used, radar, etc.
(b) Subtract the time of the last known or reported position from the time of the distress incident.
(c) Multiply the length of this time interval by the estimated speed of advance over the ground prior

to the distress incident to get the distance travelled since the last known or reported position.
(d) Advance the last known or reported position along the intended track, based on the distance 
computed in the previous step. This is the datum point for the distress incident.
(e) If the datum point is in the marine environment, go to the Datum worksheet in this appendix. 
Otherwise, go to the Total probable error of position worksheet at the end of this appendix.

When no maritime drift is involved, the drift error (De) is set to zero.
(f) Once the total probable error of position ( E) has been estimated, go to the Effort allocation 
worksheet (datum point or datum line) in appendix L to plan the search. An initial probability 
map may be prepared by following the instructions provided in appendix M for point datums.

Appendix K – Determining datum
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) K-3
 No communication received after the last position report
K.2.6 This is a relatively common situation in search and rescue but it is by far the most difficult because so 
many scenarios are possible, making the possibility area very large. The possible scenarios are similar 
to those for which the time but not the position of a distress is known. The only difference is that a

range of times for the distress incident are now possible as well as a larger range of locations. The 
earliest possible time for the distress incident is immediately following the last time when the distressed 
persons were known to be safe. Usually this is assumed to be the time of the last communication 
with the craft. The latest possible time for the distress incident is either the time at which all control

over the craft’s movements must have ceased (usually the time of fuel exhaustion) or the present time, 
whichever is earlier.
K.2.7 When an aircraft or vessel disappears en route, the first assumption is that the aircraft or vessel is in 
distress on or near the intended track. (There is also the possibility that it is not in distress but has 
experienced a communications failure and is proceeding in accordance with the current flight or

voyage plan.) In the distress scenario, the possible locations of the craft will be concentrated in the 
immediate vicinity of the craft’s intended track. If no other information is available, the datum will 
normally be assumed to be a line that follows the intended route from the last known or reported 
position to the destination. An initial probability map for the possible distress incident locations may

be prepared using the instructions provided in appendix M for line datums. The Effort allocation 
worksheet (datum point or datum line) in appendix L may be used to plan the search.
 Information, other than position, received since last position report
K.2.8 When the last communication received from an en-route aircraft or vessel is not a position report 
but other communication which did not indicate any distress, three possible scenarios are normally

considered and prioritized in the following order:
(a) Scenario 1: The distress incident occurred immediately following the last communication.
(b) Scenario 2: The craft continued along its intended track and the distress incident occurred a 
significant time after the last communication.
(c) Scenario 3: The craft diverted toward an alternate destination, such as the nearest safe port or 
an alternate aerodrome, and became distressed a significant time after the last communication.

This includes the possibility that the craft reversed direction and the alternate destination was the 
departure point.
K.2.9 In this situation, it is necessary to prepare a generalized probability map consisting of at least three 
sub-areas prior to planning any search efforts. The three sub-areas would correspond to the three 
scenarios.
(a) The first sub-area is determined by estimating the craft’s position at the time of the last

communication and centering an area of reasonable size on that point. The total probable error 
of position may be used as a guide in estimating a reasonable size for this sub-area. This sub-area 
should be assigned a POC value that makes its probability density higher than that in either of 
the other two sub-areas.
(b) The second sub-area extends along the intended track from where the first sub-area ends to the

destination and is given a reasonable width. The total probable error of position may be used 
as a guide for estimating a reasonable width. This sub-area should be assigned a POC value 
that makes its probability density fall approximately halfway between that of the first and third 
sub-areas.
(c) The third sub-area extends along the track the craft would have followed had it diverted to the 
alternate destination. It begins where the first sub-area (and possibly part of the second as well)

ends and extends to the alternate destination. The total probable error of position may be used 
as a guide for estimating a reasonable width for this sub-area. The POC value for this sub-area 
should be chosen so that the probability density is less than that of the other two sub-areas.

Appendix K – Determining datum
K-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
(d) If it is certain that the survivors are in one of these three areas, their initial POC values should 
add up to 100%. Otherwise, the remainder of the possibility area for these scenarios needs to 
be defined and assigned a POC value that makes the total equal 100%. It may be advisable to 
construct a suitable grid for the possibility area and assign POC values to the grid cells based on the

sub-area(s) within which they lie. Instructions for preparing generalized probability maps are given 
in appendix M. The Effort allocation worksheet (generalized distribution) in appendix L should be 
used to plan the search.
K.3 Estimating survivor location following a distress incident
 Aeronautical drift
K.3.1 When an aircraft experiences a serious casualty, such as an engine failure, the pilot will normally

attempt to maintain altitude as long as possible. If the casualty cannot be corrected and the pilot is 
forced to descend, this will be done by either gliding or, if a parachute is available, bailing out.
(a) Gliding. The safest descent may involve gliding or flying at greatly reduced power toward the 
most suitable available site for a forced, off-aerodrome landing. Aircraft can glide a considerable 
distance. The key factors are power-off rate of descent, glide airspeed, and height above the

surface. Since glide ratios vary widely, the manufacturer of the distressed aircraft or pilots 
experienced with that type of aircraft should be consulted regarding glide and forced landing 
characteristics.
(b) Parachute. If parachutes are available, the pilot in command may elect to use this method of 
descent. This situation is rare in civil aviation but more common in military aviation. If the

survivors leave the aircraft while it is still airborne, their landing site and the crash site of the aircraft 
may be widely separated from each other and from the bailout position. Drift characteristics 
for modern civilian parachutes can vary widely. For civilian cases, the manufacturer of the 
parachute or another knowledgeable source should be consulted for the information needed 
to determine how far the survivor(s) may have drifted during descent. Drift computations for

parachutes may be completed using the Aeronautical drift worksheet in this appendix together 
with the parachute drift tables provided in appendix N.
 Maritime drift
K.3.2 Two types of forces cause survival craft on the ocean to move or drift: wind and current. To compute 
the area where the survivors may be located, it is necessary to estimate the rate and direction of 
drift. This requires estimates of the winds and currents in and around the area containing the possible

distress locations. The two components of drift are total water current (TWC) and leeway. The Datum 
worksheet for computing drift in the marine environment and its supporting worksheets describe how 
to estimate survivor motion due to environmental forces.
(a) Total water current (TWC) can have several components. Some or all of the following may be 
included:
(1) Sea current (SC). This is the main large-scale flow of ocean waters. Sea currents near the

surface are of principal interest to search planners. Near shore or in shallow waters, sea 
current is usually less important than the tidal current or the local wind current. Sea currents 
are not always steady, so averages should be used with caution. Sea current estimates may 
be obtained from direct observation at the scene (such as ship set and drift, trajectories of 
drifting objects having zero leeway), output from computer models of ocean circulation,

and hydrographic tables and charts.
(2) Tidal or rotary currents. In coastal waters, currents change in direction and speed as the 
tides change. They may be estimated from tidal current tables, current charts, and pilot 
charts. However, local knowledge often will be of the greatest value.
(3) River current. This should be considered only if the survivors may be in, or near, the mouth 
of a large river (such as the Amazon).

Appendix K – Determining datum
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) K-5
(4) Local wind current (WC). Local wind current is due to the effect of sustained local winds 
on the water’s surface. The exact effect of wind in creating local wind currents is not clear, 
but it is generally assumed that after 6 to 12 h with the wind in a constant direction, a local 
surface current is generated. The estimated average wind velocity and direction for the

previous 24 to 48 h should be verified by contacting ships which have been in the vicinity 
of the distress scene. The direction and velocity of local wind current can be estimated 
using the Local wind current graph in figure N-1.
 Vector (direction and speed) values must be obtained for each current which is present and 
added, vector fashion, to obtain the total water current (TWC). Figure 4-6 in chapter 4 shows 
how to compute TWC offshore in the open ocean.

how to compute TWC offshore in the open ocean.
(b) Leeway (LW). The force of the wind against the exposed surfaces of the craft causes it to 
move through the water in a generally downwind direction. This is called leeway. A drogue 
(sea anchor) may be deployed to decrease the rate of leeway. The shapes of the exposed 
and underwater surfaces can affect the rate of leeway and cause the leeway direction to be

somewhat off the downwind direction. Estimates of wind direction and speed may be obtained 
from direct observation at the scene, output from computer models used for weather prediction, 
local weather bureaus and, as a last resort, wind roses on pilot charts. Leeway rates may be 
computed from leeway graphs provided in figures N-2 and N-3.
(c) Once the directions and speeds of the TWC and leeway vectors are estimated, the direction

and rate of survivor drift are computed by adding the leeway and TWC vectors as shown in 
figure 4-7 of chapter 4. Normally, all velocities are computed in nautical miles per hour (knots).

Aeronautical drift worksheet instructions
Introduction
The Aeronautical drift worksheet is used in conjunction with the Average wind aloft worksheet to compute 
the probable position of landing when the position of the distress incident is known. Aeronautical drift may 
consist of either gliding, parachute drift or a combination of the two. There are several things to consider with 
aeronautical drift, including:

aeronautical drift, including:
 Starting altitude   Terrain altitude 
Glide true air speed  Glide ratio 
Rate of descent   Average wind aloft
This worksheet assumes the aircraft maintains a constant heading during its descent from the distress incident 
position and that the parachute, if it has a non-zero glide ratio, also maintains a constant descent heading 
from the bailout/opening position (not necessarily the same heading as the aircraft’s glide). If either of the glide

descent headings is unknown, the glide distance should be computed and added to the distressed aircraft’s 
probable position error (X) to give a new (and larger) probable position error value for X on the Total probable 
error of position worksheet.

Average wind aloft (AWA) worksheet instructions
Introduction
The purpose of this worksheet is to compute a weighted average of wind velocity vectors over some range of

altitudes. Average wind aloft is used to compute downwind displacement of gliding aircraft and descending 
parachutes. The contribution of each wind observation or estimate is weighted according to the altitude 
range where it was in effect. For example, a wind that has been in effect for 2,000 ft will have twice as much 
influence on the average wind as one that was in effect for only 1,000 ft.
1 Making entries in the worksheet For each available wind value, enter the altitude of the

observation, the starting and ending altitudes of the interval in 
which that wind value was in effect, the number of feet (in 
thousands) in the interval (higher altitude minus lower altitude), 
the wind direction, the wind speed and the wind contribution 
for that interval (wind speed multiplied by the number of feet (in 
thousands) in the interval).
2 Computing the total altitude loss Add all the entries in the “Thousands of feet” column. Usually,

when multiplied by 1000, this value should equal the number 
of feet in the Altitude Loss from B.3 or C.6 of the Aeronautical 
drift worksheet. If it doesn’t, the difference should be explained.
3 Computing the total wind vector Using a chart, manoeuvering board, universal plotting sheet or 
calculator, add all the wind contribution vectors to get the total 
wind vector.
4 Computing the average wind aloft The direction of the average wind is the same as the direction

of the total wind vector. Divide the magnitude of the total wind 
vector by the total number of feet (in thousands) in the altitude 
loss to get the average wind speed.
5 Go to line B.10 or C.7 as appropriate of the Aeronautical drift worksheet and record the computed 
Average wind aloft.

Average surface wind (ASW) worksheet instructions
Introduction
The purpose of this worksheet is to compute a weighted average of wind velocity vectors over some period 
of time, usually a drift interval. Average surface wind is used to estimate wind current and leeway. The 
contribution of each wind observation or estimate is weighted according to the amount of time it was in effect.

For example, a wind that has been in effect for twelve hours will have twice as much influence on the average 
wind as one that was in effect for only six hours. In general, wind averages should not be used for intervals 
exceeding 24 hours in length.
Wind observations and estimates are not exact and forecast wind data are even less accurate. Furthermore, the 
winds experienced by the search object can never be known precisely. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the

probable error of the average surface wind acting on the search object and the amount of probable error this will 
introduce into the drift computations. This amount will be used to compute the total probable error of position.
A Average surface wind (ASW)
1 Surface wind data For each available wind value in this drift interval, enter the time of 
the observation, the starting and ending times of the time interval 
during which that wind value was in effect, the number of hours in

the interval (ending time minus starting time), the wind direction, the 
wind speed, and the wind contribution for that interval (wind speed 
times the number of hours in the interval).
2 Average surface wind Add the hours in the “Number of hours” column to get the “Total 
hours” (D). (The total hours should equal the number of hours in 
the drift interval from line B.2 of the Datum worksheet. If this is not 
the case, the difference should be explained.) Use a manoeuvring

board or a calculator to compute the direction ( E) and speed ( F) 
of the vector sum of all the wind contribution vectors. Copy the 
direction of this vector sum (E) to the average surface wind direction 
on line A.2 of this worksheet. Divide the speed of the vector sum 
(F) by the total hours (D) and enter the result as the average surface 
wind speed on line A.2 of this worksheet. Copy the average surface 
wind direction and speed to line C.1 of the Datum worksheet.
B Probable error

B Probable error
1 Probable error of ASW Estimate the probable error of the average surface wind. If no value 
is available, enter 5 knots for observed winds, 8 knots for forecast 
winds.
2 Probable error of drift velocity 
due to probable error of the 
Average surface wind 
(ASWDVe)
Estimate the probable error of the drift velocity that will be caused by 
the probable error of the average surface wind. If no better estimate is

available, enter 0.3 knots for observed winds that are either relatively 
steady or change gradually in speed or direction. Enter 0.5 knots for 
forecast winds and highly variable observed winds such as winds 
that suddenly shift during the passage of storms or weather fronts. 
Copy this value to line C.2 of the Datum worksheet. See note below 
for more information.
Note: The probable error of the average surface wind (ASWe) contributes to the total probable drift velocity

error (DVe) in two ways. The ASW e increases the total probable wind current error and the total probable 
leeway error. The value recorded on line B.2 of the Average surface wind (ASW) worksheet is an estimate of

Appendix K – Determining datum
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) K-21
the combined effects of the increased probable errors in wind current and leeway due to the probable error 
in the average surface wind. Caution: The probable wind current error (WCe) entered on line 7 of the Wind 
current (WC) worksheet represents only the probable error in the wind current estimate that still exists even

when the average surface wind is precisely known. It does not  include any error due to uncertainty about 
the average surface wind value used to estimate the wind current. Similarly, the probable leeway error (LWe) 
entered on line 7 of the Leeway (LW) worksheet represents only  the probable error in the leeway estimate 
that still exists even when the average surface wind is precisely known. It also does not include any error due

to uncertainty about the average surface wind value used to estimate the leeway.

Total water current (TWC) worksheet instructions
Introduction
Total water current may be determined by observing the drift of objects that have little or no leeway. Total 
water current may also be determined or estimated using data from tidal current tables, sea current atlases, a 
wind current graph or computational procedure, and other sources. Often the Total Water Current will be the

vector sum of two or more of these values.
None of the values will be exact and each will have at least some probable error. It is necessary to estimate the 
sizes of these probable errors. If two or more current vectors are added to determine the total water current, 
then the probable error of the total water current must be computed from the probable errors of the individual 
currents. This value will then be used to compute the total probable error of position.

If available, observed total water current at or near the scene is preferable to computed or estimated values. 
If total water current observations are available, complete Part A of this worksheet and record the result in 
Part D of the Datum worksheet. If total water current observations are not available, complete the applicable 
sections of Part B of this worksheet and record the result in Part D of the Datum worksheet.

A Observed total water current Datum marker buoys (DMBs) and debris with little freeboard 
tend to drift with the surface current. Early observations 
derived from relocating identifiable objects may be 
questionable due to navigational error. Self-locating DMBs 
are generally very accurate although the data returned may 
require some processing to be useful.

position errors of the observations, the distance between 
the observations and the search object’s probable starting

position, the amount of time since the last observation, 
and the amount of variability of the currents in the area of 
interest. If the observations are considered to be of good 
to excellent quality and representative of the current at 
the search object’s (unknown) location, enter 0.1  knots. 
Otherwise, enter 0.2 knots.
4 Go to Part D of the

B Computed total water current Enter values only for those currents that are present at the 
search object’s location. For any current that is not present, 
leave the set, drift, and probable error blank.
1 Tidal current (TC) General Rule: In coastal waters, tidal currents will usually be 
important. To compute tidal current, search planners should 
consult published tidal current tables, if available, for the

vicinity of the datum position. Local knowledge is also often 
of great value in dealing with drift due to tidal currents.

1 Tidal current (TC) General Rule: In coastal waters, tidal currents will usually be 
important. To compute tidal current, search planners should 
consult published tidal current tables, if available, for the

vicinity of the datum position. Local knowledge is also often 
of great value in dealing with drift due to tidal currents.

b Tidal current (TC) set/drift Enter the true direction and speed of the average, or net, 
tidal current for the drift interval.
c   Probable error of tidal 
current (TCe)
Enter the estimated probable error of the computed or 
estimated tidal current as it relates to the search object’s 
approximate location. Factors to consider include the 
distance between the reference location shown in the tidal

current tables and the search object’s probable starting 
position and the amount of variability of the currents in 
the area of interest. If no better estimate is available, enter 
0.3 knots.
2 Sea current (SC) General rule: Sea currents derived from long-term seasonal 
averages taken over a wide area (e.g. currents taken from 
a pilot chart or atlas of surface currents) are most useful in 
areas that are well off shore. Currents from these sources

generally should not be used when computing total water 
current in coastal waters, especially when the distance from 
the shore of a large land mass is less than 25 miles and the 
water depth is less than 300 feet (100 metres, 50 fathoms). 
If local and regional data on short-term coastal surface 
currents are available, or if such data are available from a 
validated computerized circulation model, these values 
should be used. If not, sea current should be ignored and

TWC should be calculated using only the wind current (WC) 
and tidal current (TC).

of large rivers into the sea can affect the currents many miles 
from shore.

Wind current (WC) worksheet instructions
Introduction
Local wind blowing over the ocean’s surface generates a current in the water. Usually this current is in addition

to the average sea current found in atlases and on pilot charts. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate this current 
and the probable error of the estimated value.
Wind current (WC) Caution: In areas where the wind is nearly constant over long periods, 
like the trade winds, it may not be appropriate to add wind current to 
the average sea current. Also, the sea current values estimated by some 
computer models include the local wind current. Search planners

should not compute and add wind current to this type of data.
1 Average surface wind (ASW) Enter the computed average surface wind from the Datum worksheet 
(line C.1).
2 Downwind direction Add (or subtract) 180° to (from) the average surface wind direction to

current that corresponds to the speed of the average surface wind on 
line 1.

4 Divergence of wind current Go to figure N-1 and find the appropriate value for the divergence 
of the wind current from the downwind direction based on the 
approximate latitude of the search object.
5 Wind current set In the northern hemisphere, add the divergence from line 4  to the 
downwind direction from line 2 . If the result is greater than 360°, 
subtract 360°. In the southern hemisphere, subtract the divergence on

line 4 from the downwind direction on line 2. If the result is less than 
zero, add 360°.
6 Wind current (WC) set/drift Enter the set from line 5 and the drift from line 3.
7 Probable wind current error

Enter the estimated probable error of the wind current. Factors to 
consider include the distance between the wind observations and the 
search object’s probable starting position, the amount of time since 
the last wind observation, and the amount of variability of the winds

in the area of interest during the drift interval. Wind current estimates 
based on the average of highly variable winds tend to have larger 
probable errors than those based on steady winds. If no better estimate 
is available, enter 0.3 knots. See note below for more information.

Note: The relationship between wind and wind current is not precisely understood, especially when there 
is significant variation in the wind over the interval of interest. For this reason the wind current estimate has 
some probable error that is independent of the probable error in the average surface wind. The probable wind

current error (WCe) entered on line 7 of the Wind current (WC) worksheet represents only the probable error 
in the wind current estimate that is still present even when the average surface wind is precisely known. It 
does not include any error due to uncertainty about the average surface wind value used to estimate the wind 
current. The additional error due to uncertainty about the average surface wind is included in the Probable

Leeway (LW) worksheet instructions
Introduction
Leeway is the movement of an object through the water due to wind and waves acting on the object. Leeway

speeds for various types of objects may be estimated by using the graphs in figures N-2 and N-3. Estimating 
leeway direction is more difficult. Lack of symmetry in the search object’s shape either above or below the 
waterline may cause it to have leeway in a direction that is not directly downwind. The leeway divergence 
angles given in figures N-2 and N-3 are the average differences between the object’s direction of leeway and

the downwind direction. For example, an object with a leeway divergence of ±45° has a leeway that is, on 
average, either 45° to the left of the downwind direction or 45° to the right of the downwind direction. Since 
the leeway of objects that tend to diverge from the downwind direction is equally likely to be to the left or 
right of the downwind direction, it is necessary to account for both possibilities. It is also necessary to account 
for the probable error of the leeway estimate.

A Types of flares and their characteristics
1 There are generally three types of flares available and used for distress signalling:
 – parachute flare: widely available parachute distress flares are used by commercial ships, fishing 
vessels and small craft mariners;
 – meteor flare: rocket type (i.e. non-parachute) flare; and
 – hand-held flare: standard international distress flare used by commercial and recreational users.

 .2   Parachute flares will only be seen as they descend – they begin burning when they reach the top 
of their trajectory.
 .3   Meteor flares may be seen over the whole of their trajectory – they burn from the moment they

B Assessing direction of flare
1 There are several options to obtain the direction or bearing of the flare:
 – clock face method;
 – bearing from a compass;

– clock face method;
 – bearing from a compass;
 – reference to a physical object (building, island, anchored ship, navigation buoy, etc.);
 – experience (seafarers can often give accurate bearings in relation to their ships heading, etc.).
2 Clock face method
 For members of the lay public, it may be best to ask them to use the clock face method. If they are on 
a beach or shoreline ask them to turn to their left or right and look along the shoreline and to imagine

a clock is laid on the ground with 12 o’clock at the top (aligned along the beach/surf line). They should 
then be asked to report what “time” the flare was e.g. 9, 10, 11, 12 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 o’clock, etc.

4  The second might be reported as 3 o’clock from the North side of the building, or the side of a 
building on a particular street, etc.
5 Other options for establishing direction of a flare are:
 – direction relative to a street direction;

– direction relative to a street direction;
 – direction relative to a line passing through reporting source’s position and another prominent 
landmark or reference point;
 – identity of prominent landmarks on either side of the line of bearing from the reporting source 
to the flare; and
 – direction relative to the general direction of the shoreline in that area.
6  An appropriate amount of bearing error will have to be added to any such reports to ensure that the

F Estimating flare distances
1  Informants should be asked to use the “clenched or closed hand” method to estimate the angle above 
(or below) the horizon that they saw the flare
2  The informant should be asked to hold their clenched/closed-hand vertically, with thumb on top, at 
arms-length, and place the bottom of the hand on the visible horizon and then to estimate how many

fingers above the horizon the flare was. Reports of less than a finger width are viable and should be 
recorded.
G Flares observed above the horizon

(In this example the flare would be reported as about 9 degrees above the horizon.)
1  The (above horizon) distance tables in appendix N on page N-22 are then used to estimate the 
minimum and maximum distances to the flare from the reporting source. Angles are determined by

converting fractions of a fist to degrees.
2 Example:
A red flare is reported using the Fist method as being 2 fingers above the horizon. The first 
informant’s height of eye is 10 ft.
Converting the fingers to degrees gives an estimated angle of observation of degrees.
• Referring to the Minimum Distance table suggests a distance of 0.57 NM
• Referring to the Maximum Distance table suggests a distance of 2.82 NM

Given this range of observed angles, the flare must be roughly between 0.6 and 2.8 NM 
from the reporting source – a separation of only 2.2 NM. A more expedient estimate is 
obtained by “rounding” the minimum distance down and the maximum distance up to the 
next 0.5 NM increment.
In this example we would therefore use a range of between 0.5 to 3.0 NM from the reporting 
source.

12 Corrected sweep width (W) Multiply the values in each column on lines 8 , 9, 10, and 11  
(uncorrected sweep width, weather/terrain correction factor, velocity 
correction factor and fatigue correction factor) to get the corrected 
sweep width.
13 Search effort (Z) Multiply the search facility’s speed ( line 3) by the search facility’s

endurance (line 6) and multiply the result by the corrected sweep 
width (line 12), or use figure N-4.
14 Total available search  
effort (Zta)
Add the individual search effort values listed on line 13  and enter 
the total.
15 Separation ratio (SR) Enter the separation ratio (SR) from line H.3 of the Datum worksheet.
16 In most cases, the separation ratio ( SR) will be less than or equal to four (SR ≤ 4) and the search

planner may go directly to the Effort allocation worksheet . However, if the separation ratio ( SR) 
entered on line 15 is greater than four ( SR > 4), an initial effort allocation decision must be made 
between the following two choices:
•  The two datums may be treated as separate single point datums, each with its own search area. 
Two separate search areas with no overlap will be the usual result.
•  A line may be drawn between the two datums and treated as the base line portion of a datum

line. In this case a single search area centred on the datum line will be the result.
The Widely diverging datums worksheet instructions  provide guidance to help the search planner 
decide which alternative to use. The Widely diverging datums worksheet helps the search planner 
make the necessary preparations for entering the Effort allocation worksheet(s).
The following conditions can lead to leeway divergence datums becoming so widely separated in

comparison to their total probable errors of position that separate search areas should be considered:
• The leeway divergence angle is large (> 30°).
• The leeway rate is moderate to large (> 1 knot).
• The time adrift is significant (> 12 h).
• The probable errors of the initial and search facility positions are small (< 1 NM).
•  The probable errors of the factors affecting drift (winds, currents, leeway) are all small (< 0.3 knot).

• The cumulative relative search effort is small to moderate (< 10).
Usually all of these conditions must be met before the separation ratio will become greater than four 
(SR > 4) and  the divergence distance (DD) will be large enough to justify dividing the available search 
effort into two portions assigned to separate, non-contiguous search areas. Only rarely will enough of 
these conditions be met to create such a situation.

Introduction

Introduction
It is possible for objects that have leeway divergence to have two widely separated datums whose associated 
probability density distributions have little or no overlap. When the distance between the datums is large in 
comparison to the probable error of each datum position, the search planner must decide whether they should 
be treated as two separate single point datums or as the end points of the base line portion of a datum line.

Experimental evidence indicates that once an object starts to have a leeway to the left of the downwind 
direction it tends to remain on that tack indefinitely. The same is true if the object starts to have a leeway 
to the right of the downwind direction. If the initial and search facility probable position errors are small, 
the leeway divergence angle is large (> 30 °), the probable errors of the winds, currents and leeway are all

small (each contributing less than 0.3 knot to the drift velocity error), etc., the divergence distance (DD) may 
become greater than four times the probable error of position (E). This is an unlikely situation. However, if it 
occurs, the search planner should seriously consider applying a portion of the available search effort to each 
datum rather than applying the total available search effort to a single large area that includes both datums

and the area between them. Objects that have large divergence angles will tend toward locations on the line 
connecting the left and right datums only if they jibe or tack downwind. There has been very little evidence of 
jibing behaviour in the leeway experiments done to date. This means that when the probable errors are small 
and the divergence angle is large, there is very little chance of the search object being halfway between the

left and right datums. If this is the case, then the area that is near the midpoint of the line connecting the left 
and right datums will not be a very productive area to search.
If the search planner decides to treat the two datums separately, then it is necessary to divide the total available 
search effort into two portions and plan two single point datum searches. Unless there is some reason to

favour one datum over the other, the total available search effort should be divided into two equal portions. 
One example of a situation where one datum should be favoured over the other is the following: Suppose a 
drifting search object was located by an aircraft and observed long enough to determine its leeway was to 
the right of the downwind direction, but then contact was lost before a homing beacon could be deployed or

a rescue facility could arrive on scene. In this case, the datum for the next search that was to the right of the 
downwind direction probably should be assigned most of the total available search effort. Whenever search 
effort is to be allocated separately to two datums, an Effort allocation worksheet  should be completed for 
each datum, using the instructions for a single point datum.

In situations where the wind has shown large and sudden changes in direction, when the sea is confused, etc., 
the search planner may decide that the probability of the search object jibing or tacking downwind is larger

datums. In these cases, the search planner should consider drawing a line between the left and right datums

and using it as the base line portion of a datum line. When the total available search effort is to be allocated in

Widely diverging datums worksheet instructions
Introduction
It is possible for objects that have leeway divergence to have two widely separated datums whose associated 
probability density distributions have little or no overlap. When the distance between the datums is large in 
comparison to the probable error of each datum position, the search planner must decide whether they should

be treated as two separate single point datums or as the end points of the base line portion of a datum line.
Experimental evidence indicates that once an object starts to have a leeway to the left of the downwind 
direction it tends to remain on that tack indefinitely. The same is true if the object starts to have a leeway 
to the right of the downwind direction. If the initial and search facility probable position errors are small,

the leeway divergence angle is large (> 30 °), the probable errors of the winds, currents and leeway are all 
small (each contributing less than 0.3 knot to the drift velocity error), etc., the divergence distance (DD) may 
become greater than four times the probable error of position (E). This is an unlikely situation. However, if it 
occurs, the search planner should seriously consider applying a portion of the available search effort to each

datum rather than applying the total available search effort to a single large area that includes both datums 
and the area between them. Objects that have large divergence angles will tend toward locations on the line 
connecting the left and right datums only if they jibe or tack downwind. There has been very little evidence of 
jibing behaviour in the leeway experiments done to date. This means that when the probable errors are small

and the divergence angle is large, there is very little chance of the search object being halfway between the 
left and right datums. If this is the case, then the area that is near the midpoint of the line connecting the left 
and right datums will not be a very productive area to search.
If the search planner decides to treat the two datums separately, then it is necessary to divide the total available

search effort into two portions and plan two single point datum searches. Unless there is some reason to 
favour one datum over the other, the total available search effort should be divided into two equal portions. 
One example of a situation where one datum should be favoured over the other is the following: Suppose a 
drifting search object was located by an aircraft and observed long enough to determine its leeway was to

the right of the downwind direction, but then contact was lost before a homing beacon could be deployed or 
a rescue facility could arrive on scene. In this case, the datum for the next search that was to the right of the 
downwind direction probably should be assigned most of the total available search effort. Whenever search 
effort is to be allocated separately to two datums, an Effort allocation worksheet  should be completed for 
each datum, using the instructions for a single point datum.

In situations where the wind has shown large and sudden changes in direction, when the sea is confused, etc., 
the search planner may decide that the probability of the search object jibing or tacking downwind is larger 
than usual. The search planner may have other reasons for covering all of the area between the left and right 
datums. In these cases, the search planner should consider drawing a line between the left and right datums

and using it as the base line portion of a datum line. When the total available search effort is to be allocated in 
this fashion, a single Effort allocation worksheet should be completed following the instructions for a datum 
line.

datums. Circle “a” or “b” as appropriate. If “a” is circled, go to 
line 5. If “b” is circled, go to line 6.
5 Two separate point datums In this case, the total available search effort is to be divided into

two parts. One part will be applied to a search area centred on 
one of the datums while the other part will be applied to a search 
area centred on the other datum.
a  Available search effort for 
the left datum (Za(left))
Enter the amount of search effort that will be applied to the left 
datum. This amount must be between zero and the total available

Add the search effort available for the left datum (line 5.a) to the 
search effort available for the right datum ( line 5.b). The result 
should equal the total available search effort (line 1). If this is not

true, adjust the efforts for the left and right datums so their sum 
equals the total available search effort (line 1).

Effort allocation worksheet instructions for optimal search of single point, 
leeway divergence or line datums
Introduction
This Effort allocation worksheet is used to determine the optimal way to allocate the available search effort

around a single datum point, over two divergent datum points or along a datum line. It considers the search 
effort that several dissimilar search facilities can provide. The worksheet also aids in computing the optimal 
area to search and the optimum uniform coverage factor. Finally, the worksheet provides guidance for 
determining the actual search sub-area dimensions for each available search facility. This worksheet is based 
on a DAYLIGHT VISUAL SEARCH.

Effort allocation computations
1 Available search effort (Za) Enter the total available search effort (Zta) from line 14 of the Total

available search effort worksheet unless the left and right datums 
are to be treated as separate searches. In that case, two Effort 
allocation worksheets will be required. Enter the available effort 
for the left datum (Za(left)) on one worksheet and the available effort 
for the right datum (Za(right)) on the other worksheet.
2 Effort factor (fZ) The effort factor (fZ) provides a standard method for characterizing 
the size of the area where the search object is probably located.

Although the effort factor has units of area , its value is only a 
fraction of the area where the search object may be located.
(a)  Total probable error of  
position (E)
Enter the total probable error of position ( E) from line H.2  of the 
Datum worksheet.
(b) Length of datum line (L) For line datums only: Measure or compute the length of the base 
line (Lb) connecting two points, such as the last known position 
of a vessel or aircraft and the next point at which a report was

expected but not received. When appropriate, extend the base 
line in one or both directions by an amount equal to E to form the 
datum line (L).
Examples:
(i) A vessel’s intended track lies between two ports, the LKP was 
the port of departure and the vessel is overdue at its destination. 
The base line is not extended over land in either direction and 
L = Lb.
(ii) A vessel’s intended track lies between its last reported

position at sea and its next port of call, where it is overdue. In this 
situation, the seaward end of the base line is extended by E and 
L = Lb + E.
(iii) Both the last reported position and the next position where 
the vessel or aircraft was expected to report might be in error. 
In this situation, both ends of the base line are extended by E 
and L = Lb + (2 × E). Figure L-4 depicts this situation.

iii Line datum Enter the length of the base line portion (Lb) of the datum line. The 
length of the adjusted search area depends on whether the datum 
line was formed with zero, one, or two extensions as described in 
the instructions for line 2.b.
a) No extensions If the base line was not extended in either direction to form the 
datum line, then the length of the adjusted search area is the same

as the length of the base line (Lb). Length = Lb
b) One extension If only one end of the base line was extended to form the datum 
line, then the length of the adjusted search area is the adjusted 
search radius (R) plus the length of the base line (Lb). Length = R + Lb
c) Two extensions If the base line was extended in both directions to form the 
datum line, then the length of the adjusted search area is twice 
the adjusted search radius (R) plus the length of the base line (Lb).

Length = (2 × R) + Lb
b Width The formula used to find the width of the adjusted search area 
is the same in all cases. The width is always equal to twice the 
adjusted search radius (R). Stated as a formula, Width = 2 × R
15 Plot the adjusted search area  
on a suitable chart
Using a suitable chart, plot the adjusted search square(s) or rectangle 
centred on the datum(s).
a Single point datum Using the datum position as the centre, draw a circle with its radius

equal to the adjusted search radius (R) from line 13. Estimate the 
direction of search object drift during the search. Circumscribe a 
square around the circle and orient the square so the search legs 
will be parallel to the predicted direction of drift during the search. 
In figure L-1 it is assumed the direction of drift during the search 
will be the same as the average direction of drift from the last 
known position.

b  Leeway divergence  
datums
Using each of the datum positions as a centre, draw a circle around 
each datum with its radius equal to the adjusted search radius (R) 
from line 13. Based on the distance separating the circles, decide 
whether to use a single rectangle as shown in figure L-2 or two 
squares as shown in figure L-3 . Estimate the directions of search 
object drift during the search. Orient the search sub-areas so

the search legs are as nearly parallel as possible to the predicted 
directions of search object drift during the search. However, do 
not compromise safety of search facility navigation in adjacent 
search sub-areas.
c Line datum Instructions for plotting the adjusted search area depend on whether 
the datum line was formed with zero, one, or two extensions as 
described in the instructions for line 2.b.
i No extensions If the base line was not extended in either direction to form the

datum line, draw lines perpendicular to the base line at each end. 
On each of these perpendicular lines, use a compass or dividers to 
measure a distance equal to the adjusted search radius (R) in each 
direction from the datum line. Using these four points as the corner 
points, plot the rectangular adjusted search area. (See figure L-5.)

Appendix L – Search planning and evaluation worksheets
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) L-13
ii One extension If the base line was extended in only one direction to form the 
datum line, draw a line perpendicular to the base line at the end 
that was not extended. Measure a distance equal to the adjusted 
search radius (R) in each direction from the datum line along the 
perpendicular line. These two points will be two of the corner

points of the rectangular adjusted search area. Using the other end 
of the base line as the centre, draw a circle with its radius equal to 
the adjusted search radius (R). Draw a rectangle that includes the 
previous two corner points and the circle. (See figure L-6.)
iii Two extensions If the base line was extended in both directions to form the datum 
line, draw a circle with a radius equal to the adjusted search radius 
(R) around each end point of the base line. Be certain to use the

end points of the base line as the centres of the circles, not the end 
points of the datum line. Circumscribe a single rectangle around 
both circles. (See figure L-7.)
16 Adjust the locations, lengths and widths of the search sub-areas so they fill the total adjusted search 
area as nearly as possible. The following guidelines may be used:
(a)  The width of each search sub-area must equal a whole number of track spacings. Some

adjustment of track spacings may be made, but care must be taken to ensure all track spacings 
remain within the usable limits of the assigned search facility’s navigational capability.
(b)  The search legs should be parallel to the search object’s anticipated direction of movement 
during the search.
(c)  For fixed-wing aircraft, a flying time of about 30 minutes per search leg is recommended. For 
rotary-wing aircraft, a flying time of about 20 minutes is recommended.

Note 1:  POS values tend to be very stable near the point of perfectly optimal effort allocation. This 
allows search planners the freedom needed to adapt the optimal allocation of effort to account for 
practical considerations imposed by the environment and the capabilities of the search facilities. 
Normally, small changes from the optimal values indicated in lines 10–14 that are needed to make the 
search plan practical will not have a large impact on search effectiveness (POS).

Note 2: Do not use the POS graphs (figures N-11 and N-12) for searches of leeway divergence datums. 
The variations in the relationship between divergence distance and the probable error of position 
create a situation that is too complex to represent on a graph. For the same reason, no templates for 
constructing probability maps for two leeway divergence datums are provided in appendix M.

17  Go to the Search action plan worksheet where the plotted search sub-areas of line 16 will be specified 
in one of the standard formats (methods) such as the corner-point method. The search action plan 
will also provide all necessary coordination instructions such as assigning specific search facilities 
to specific search sub-areas, search patterns, altitudes to each aircraft, commence search points, 
direction of creep (for parallel sweep and creeping line search patterns), etc.

Effort allocation worksheet instructions for optimal search  
of a generalized distribution
Introduction
This Effort allocation worksheet is used to determine the optimal way to allocate the available search effort 
for a generalized distribution of search object location probabilities. It considers the search effort that several

dissimilar search facilities can provide. The worksheet also aids in computing the optimal area to search and 
the optimum uniform coverage factor. Finally, the worksheet provides guidance for determining the actual 
search sub-area dimensions for each available search facility. This worksheet is based on a daylight visual 
search which does not continue beyond sunset.
Effort allocation computations

Effort allocation computations
1 “Total available search effort” Obtain from line 14 of the Total available search effort worksheet.
2 “Prepare probability map” To plan the first search, prepare a probability map using an 
appropriate, convenient grid. If an appropriate grid does not 
already exist, it will be necessary to create one. In either situation, 
a probability value must be assigned to each grid cell based on the 
known facts and the search planner’s best judgement. The sum of

all cell probabilities on the first probability map should be 100%. 
See instructions on page M-8.
For the second and later searches, ensure cell probabilities have 
been adjusted for all previous searching and that cell locations, 
shapes, and sizes reflect the effects of the search object’s probable 
motion, if any. Appendix M contains instructions for preparing 
probability maps.
3 “Probability map cell size” Record the dimensions of one cell of the probability map.

4 “Area of one cell of the  
probability map”
Multiply the dimensions recorded on line 3 and record the result.
5 “First trial area” Plot one or more rectangles whose total area is approximately equal 
to the total available search effort from line 1  on the probability 
map. The size, shape, and placement of the rectangle(s) should be 
that which maximizes the amount of probability contained in the 
rectangle(s). If desired, the rectangle(s) may be adjusted so a whole

number of cells is covered. Compute the actual total area of the 
plotted rectangle(s) and enter it on this line.
6 “First trial coverage” Divide the total available effort from line 1  by the first trial area 
from line 5 and record the result.
7 “First trial POD” Indicate with a check mark whether search conditions are ideal or 
normal. Use the appropriate curve from figure N-10 to determine 
the POD and record the result on this line.

the POD and record the result on this line.
8 “First trial POC” Using the probability map, add the probabilities of all the cells 
and portions of cells contained in the first trial area and record the 
result.
9 “First trial POS” Multiply the first trial POD from line 7 by the first trial POC from 
line 8 and record the result.

Appendix L – Search planning and evaluation worksheets
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) L-21
10 “Second trial area” Plot one or more rectangles whose total area is approximately 
equal to twice the total available search effort from line 1 on the 
probability map. The size, shape, and placement of the rectangle(s) 
should be that which maximizes the amount of probability 
contained in the rectangle(s). If desired, the rectangle(s) may be

adjusted so a whole number of cells is covered. Compute the 
actual total area of the plotted rectangle(s) and enter it on this line.
11 “Second trial coverage” Divide the total available effort from line 1 by the second trial area 
from line 10 and record the result.
12 “Second trial POD” Indicate with a check mark whether search conditions are ideal or 
normal. Use the appropriate curve from figure N-10 to determine 
the POD and record the result on this line.

the POD and record the result on this line.
13 “Second trial POC” Using the probability map, add the probabilities of all the cells and 
portions of cells contained in the second trial area and record the 
result.
14 “Second trial POS” Multiply the second trial POD from line 12  by the second trial 
POC from line 13 and record the result.
15 “Third trial area” Plot one or more rectangles whose total area is approximately 
equal to two-thirds of the total available search effort from line 1

on the probability map. The size, shape, and placement of the 
rectangle(s) should be that which maximizes the amount of 
probability contained in the rectangle(s). If desired, the rectangle(s) 
may be adjusted so a whole number of cells is covered. Compute 
the actual total area of the plotted rectangle(s) and enter it on this 
line.
16 “Third trial coverage” Divide the total available effort from line 1 by the third trial area 
from line 15 and record the result.

from line 15 and record the result.
17 “Third trial POD” Indicate with a check mark whether search conditions are ideal or 
normal. Use the appropriate curve from figure N-10 to determine 
the POD and record the result on this line.
18 “Third trial POC” Using the probability map, add the probabilities of all the cells and 
portions of cells contained in the third trial area and record the 
result.
19 “Third trial POS” Multiply the third trial POD from line 17  by the third trial POC

from line 18 and record the result.
20 “Best trial” Compare the trial POS values on lines 9 , 14, and 19. Circle the 
number (1, 2, or 3) corresponding to the trial having the highest 
POS.
21 “Optimal search area” Record the area corresponding to the trial circled on line 20.
22 “Optimal coverage factor” Divide the total available search effort from line 1 by the optimal 
search area on line 21.
23 “Optimal track spacing” Divide the corrected sweep widths (W) from line 12 of the Total

available search effort worksheet by the optimal coverage factor 
(Co) from line 22.
24 “Nearest assignable track 
 spacing”
Round the optimal track spacing on line 23  to a value that the 
corresponding search facility can navigate safely and accurately.

Appendix L – Search planning and evaluation worksheets
L-22 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
25 “Adjusted search areas” Multiply the search facility’s speed from line 3 of the Total Available 
search effort worksheet  by the search facility’s endurance from 
line 6 of the Total available search effort worksheet and multiply 
the result by the nearest assignable track spacing from line 24  of 
this worksheet. Stated as a formula, A = V × T × S. Figure N-9

may also be used to find the adjusted search areas.
26  Using the adjusted search areas from line 25 and a suitable chart, plot corresponding search sub-areas 
to fill the rectangle(s) corresponding to the best trial from line 20  as nearly as possible. Use the 
following guidelines:
(a) The width of each search sub-area must be a whole number of track spacings. Some adjustment 
of track spacings may be made, but care must be taken to ensure all track spacings remain within

the usable limits of search facility navigational capability.
(b) The search legs should be parallel to the search object’s anticipated direction of movement 
during the search.
(c) For fixed-wing aircraft, search legs should require about 30 minutes flying time. For rotary-wing 
aircraft, search legs should require about 20 minutes flying time.
  Note: POS values tend to be very stable near the point of perfectly optimal effort allocation. This

allows the search planner the freedom needed to adapt the theoretically optimal allocation of effort 
to the realities imposed by the environment and the capabilities of the search facilities. Normally, the 
small changes from the nearly optimal values indicated in line 25 for the purpose of developing a 
practical search plan will not have a large impact on search effectiveness (POS). Therefore, the search 
planner may make such changes with confidence.

specified in one of the standard formats (methods) such as the corner-point method. The search 
action plan will also provide all necessary coordination instructions, such as assigning specific search 
facilities to specific sub-areas, search patterns, altitudes to each aircraft search facility, commence

search points, direction of creep (for parallel sweep and creeping line search patterns), etc.

Introduction
The results of each search must be evaluated before the next search for the survivors is planned. Even if

nothing is found by the search facilities, the fact that a sub-area was searched changes the search planner’s 
estimate of the survivors’ most probable location. The procedure described below allows the search planner 
to update the probability map so it accurately reflects the search results. It also allows the search planner to 
compute the probability of success for each search and the cumulative probability of success for all searches 
done to date.

4 “Probability map cell size” Enter the length and width of a cell. (It is assumed that all cells 
have the same dimensions and are therefore the same size as one

13 “Update POCs” For each cell or portion of a cell actually searched, multiply the 
last computed POC in that cell or portion of the cell by the POC 
multiplier from line 12  for the sub-area containing the cell or 
portion. Record the POC new for that cell on a fresh probability 
map. Complete the new probability map by copying the POC

values for the remaining (unsearched) cells from the previous 
probability map. See the note at the end of these instructions for 
proper handling of partially covered cells.
14 “Total POC after searching” Add the POC values from all cells on the new probability map to 
get the total probability of containment remaining after the latest 
search.
15 “Probability of success” Subtract line 14 from line 6.
16 “Cumulative probability of 
success”

16 “Cumulative probability of 
success”
Add the POS on line 15 to the sum of all previous POS values. (In 
other words, add this POS to the previous POSc value.) For point 
and line datums, if the optimal search recommendations have been 
followed, then the value of POSc computed here should be close 
to that estimated from the appropriate Cumulative POS graph. For 
point datums, the Cumulative POS graph is figure N-11 ; for line 
datums, the Cumulative POS Graph is figure N-12.

datums, the Cumulative POS Graph is figure N-12.
  Note: If a cell is only partially contained in a search sub-area, assume the probability in the cell 
is uniformly distributed and include the appropriate fraction of its value in the POC and POS 
computations. For example, if one-third of a cell’s area is contained in the search sub-area and the 
POC value for the whole cell is 6%, then the POC for the portion inside the search sub-area is 2% and

the POC for the portion outside is 4%. If the POD for that search sub-area is 50%, then the adjusted 
POC for the portion inside the search sub-area is:
 POC 1/3-new = POD × POC1/3-old 
 or
 POC 1/3-new = 0.50 × 0.02 = 0.01 or 1%
  To get the POCnew value for the entire cell, it is necessary to add the value just computed (1%) to the 
POC of the unsearched portion (4%) to get the correct value of 5%. That is, for the cell as a whole:
 POC new = POC1/3-new + POC2/3-old 
 or

POC new = POC1/3-new + POC2/3-old 
 or
 POC new = 0.01 + 0.04 = 0.05 or 5%
  If the cell was divided between two or more search sub-areas having different PODs, then each 
portion must be updated separately and the resulting POCnew for the cell computed as the sum of the 
POCnew values for each portion.
  If many cells on a probability map are only partially covered, the need for computations like those

illustrated above can substantially increase the computational burden on the search planner. Whenever 
possible, probability maps and search sub-areas should be adjusted so the number of cells only 
partially covered is minimized.

M-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
Preparing initial probability maps for single point datums instructions
Introduction
Before the results of the first search can be fully evaluated, a probability map must be prepared. The following 
steps describe how to prepare an initial probability map for a point datum using the standard point datum

probability maps in this appendix. (Full evaluation of the second and later searches depends on keeping the 
probability map updated to reflect all searching that has been done and any search object motion that has been 
estimated. Procedures for updating probability maps are provided with the Search evaluation worksheet.)
There are two methods for preparing point datum probability maps. The first and simplest method is to

determine which of the standard probability maps is best for the situation and make a photocopy for direct use. 
The disadvantage is that the search planner must determine the appropriate scale (miles per inch, kilometres 
per centimetre, etc.) to use for plotting information on the probability map. Search sub-areas and any other 
important geographic information must be properly scaled and plotted on the probability map for it to be 
useful.

useful.
The second, and preferred, method is to plot a similar grid, drawn to the proper scale, on a tracing paper or 
plastic overlay for the map or chart being used to plan the search. The advantage of doing this is that, apart 
from plotting the grid and entering the POC values in the appropriate cells, all other geographic information 
is either already on the chart or would normally be plotted on an overlay (such as search sub-areas).

1 “Total probable error of position” Enter the total probable error of position ( E) from line H.2  of the 
Datum worksheet.
2 “Adjusted search area width” Enter the width of the adjusted search area from line 14.b of the 
Effort allocation worksheet.
3 “Adjusted search radius” Divide line 2 by 2.0 and enter the result.
4 “Adjusted search factor” Divide line 3 by line 1 and record the result.
5 “Standard probability map” Enter table M-1 in with the adjusted search factor from line 4, find

the nearest value in the first column and enter the letter which 
appears in the second column. If more than one letter appears, 
choose one of the alternatives. Usually, the first letter will be the 
best choice. When the adjusted search factor is the same as the 
search factor in column 1, the width of the adjusted search area 
will correspond to a whole number of cell widths.
6 “Cell width” Enter table M-2 with the letter from line 5, perform the multiplication

indicated in column 2, and record the result.
7 “Probability map scale” Enter the scale of miles (or other measure). All of the grids printed 
in this volume are based on a scale of:
Two centimetres = E nautical miles or 
One centimetre = E/2 nautical miles
Other scales are:
One inch = 1.27 × E nautical miles
and
One centimetre = 0.926 × E kilometres.
8  For direct use, select the probability map indicated by the letter on line 5 from this appendix, make a

working copy, and record the total probable error of position (E), cell width, and scale on the working 
copy.

9  To plot the probability map on an overlay for the chart or map being used to plan the search, follow 
these steps:

Before the results of the first search can be fully evaluated, a probability map must be prepared. The following 
steps describe how to prepare an initial probability map for an area datum when the search object is more

likely to be in some parts of the area and less likely to be in other parts. In this situation the distribution of 
search object location probabilities is not uniform. (Full evaluation of the second and later searches depends 
on keeping the probability map updated to reflect all searching that has been done and any search object 
motion that has been estimated. Procedures for updating probability maps are provided with the Search 
evaluation worksheet.)

evaluation worksheet.)
1  Plot the scenario’s datum (possibility) area on a tracing paper or plastic overlay for an appropriate map 
or chart.
2  Plot a grid on the overlay that divides the area into rectangular cells of equal size.
3  Based on the facts and assumptions used to develop the scenario, estimate the initial probability of 
containment (POC) for each cell in the datum area and record that value in the cell as plotted on the 
overlay.

overlay.
 The probability map is now ready for use in evaluating the first search.

N-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
Probable errors of position
Initial position error ( X) and Search craft position error ( Y) are the estimated errors of position based on 
navigational accuracy of the distressed craft and of the search facilities.
If information on the means of navigation used by the distressed craft or by a search facility is available, the

navigational fix errors (Fixe) listed in table N-1 may be used for positions reported as navigation fixes (X = Fixe 
or Y = Fixe).
Table N-1 – Navigational fix errors
Means of navigation Fix errors (NM) 
GNSS 0.1 NM 
Radar 1 NM 
Visual fix (3 lines)* 1 NM 
Celestial fix (3 lines)* 2 NM 
Marine radio beacon 4 NM (3-beacon fix) 
LORAN C 1 NM 
INS 0.5 NM per flight hour without position update 
VOR ±3° arc and 3% of distance or 0.5 NM radius, whichever is greater

TACAN ±3° arc and 3% of distance or 0.5 NM radius, whichever is greater 
* Should be evaluated upward according to circumstances.
If the means of navigation used by the distressed craft or by a search facility is unknown, then Fixe is equal to:
Table N-2 – Fix errors by craft type
Type of craft Fixe
Ships, military submarines, and aircraft with more than two engines 5 NM 
Twin-engine aircraft 10 NM 
Boats, submersibles, and single-engine aircraft 15 NM

When the initially reported position of the distressed craft is based on dead reckoning (DR) or the search 
facility must use DR navigation, an additional error is assumed for the distance travelled since the last fix. The 
position error is the sum of the fix error (Fixe) plus the DR error (DRe). Table N-3 gives DRe for various craft.
Table N-3 – Dead reckoning errors
Type of craft DRe
Ship 5% of the DR distance 
Submarine (military) 5% of the DR distance

Submarine (military) 5% of the DR distance 
Aircraft (more than two engines) 5% of the DR distance 
Aircraft (twin-engine) 10% of the DR distance 
Aircraft (single-engine) 15% of the DR distance 
Submersible 15% of the DR distance 
Boat 15% of the DR distance

Functional characteristics to consider with computer-based 
search planning aids
Overview
The computer software, hereinafter referred to as the search planning model, should be designed to accept 
all inputs that the SAR Coordinator can reasonably be expected to use in search planning and present the 
calculated results to the Coordinator as usable information in the form of an optimal search plan, useful

statistics and values important to the search planning process. It should not simply produce a mass of data 
outputs. The desirable functional characteristics of the search planning model should include, but should not 
be limited to, those in the following list. The model should perform the following functions:
• Accept and integrate various environmental data from multiple sources, together with their 
estimated error and variability patterns;

estimated error and variability patterns;
• Simulate the effects of the environment on search object status and motion, sensor performance 
and the survivors;
• Use appropriate sampling techniques for simulating possible search object movements (e.g. drift), 
and determining the area of containment;
• Have the flexibility to develop updated search plans based on new information or assumptions 
made by the search planner;

made by the search planner;
• Have the ability to allow for time uncertainty and/or position uncertainty of the initial distress 
location;
• Simulate hazards, possible encounters between the missing craft and the hazards, and the 
probabilities that such encounters would result in a distress incident;
• Have the ability to generate initial probability density distributions using the previous two features 
together;

together;
• Be capable of simulating post-distress changes (state changes) in the status of distressed persons 
such as abandoning a vessel into a liferaft;
• Be capable of predicting the survivability of distressed persons based on selectable scenarios and 
when computing optimal effort allocations;
• Generate valid probability density distributions of possible search object locations based on 
post-distress search object trajectories using low- to high-resolution * environmental data, as

available (high-resolution data are always preferred);
• Be capable of handling multiple scenarios simultaneously which includes the ability to compare the 
scenarios and assign weighting factors to them;
• Produce an operationally feasible search plan that maximizes the probability of finding the 
distressed persons alive with the available search facilities – i.e. produce an optimal search plan 
for the situation at hand. Factors to consider are the possible (weighted) scenarios, the dynamic

probability density distribution of search object locations, survivor state changes, survival times, 
* High-resolution data are data on a small spatial (e.g. 0.1 × 0.1 degree or 6 NM × 6 NM at the equator) and temporal (e.g. every 
three hours) grid. Low-resolution data would be on larger grids (e.g. 1 × 1 degree × 24 hours or greater).

environmental parameters, search facility characteristics (number, type, location, endurance, 
sensors, etc.), previous search results, etc. Both tactical (myopic, day-to-day or sortie-to-sortie) 
and strategic optimization (when resource availability can be predicted with reasonable certainty) 
should be available;

should be available;
• Be able to properly evaluate search results (in the computational sense), including both positive 
(e.g. debris sightings) and negative (no sightings of search object) aspects. It should perform detailed 
updates of the dynamic probability density distributions of the possible search object locations 
based on actual sortie tracks and reports of sensor performance;
• Make proper use of previous search results when computing optimal plans for subsequent searches;

• Correctly simulate the effects of the relative motion between moving search objects and moving 
search facilities;
• Compute and display estimates of search effectiveness in the form of POS values for sorties and the 
cumulative POS value for all searching done to date;
• Be capable of processing and re-evaluating new (including late-arriving) information such as update 
of last known position and/or distress time to produce an updated optimal search plan;

• Consideration should be given to the man–machine interface so that the information generated by 
the computer-based tool and database would be useful to the search planner. The model should 
also be capable of displaying large volumes of information in ways that promote rapid assimilation. 
The model should contain or be integrated with appropriate geographical displays and useful tools 
for describing search sub-areas, generating search patterns, communicating search plans to search

facilities, etc.; and
• Finally, the software of such a model must be developed using sound software engineering 
principles to keep life-cycle costs down, maximize reliability, provide for ease of making future 
improvements, and have it operate with as many hardware platforms and operating systems as 
possible.

F/V Sample – alpha search
Alpha search scenario 1 On 25 January 2000 at 2145Z, the F/V Sample  broadcast a distress 
radio call. The captain reported the vessel's engines were inoperable 
and the vessel was taking on water, but the vessel was not in immediate 
danger of sinking. However, the captain requested assistance. The 
vessel's reported DR position at 2145Z was given as 37-10N, 065-45W. 
This DR position was based on a celestial fix at 250100Z JAN 00

in position 38-57N, 068-54W. Communications were lost after this 
initial call for assistance.
2 A British Airways flight transiting the area while en route to Bermuda 
at 261100Z JAN 00 failed to sight the F/V Sample. Based on enquiries 
about resource availability, the earliest time at which a search can 
commence is 261630Z JAN 00. A search is to be planned for this

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) S-1
Appendix S
Search planning for 121.5 MHz distress beacon alerts
1.  Searching for beacons is often difficult, and may be impossible without additional information. 
However, the methods in this appendix should be followed as practicable.
2.  Search planning for 121.5 MHz beacon alerts typically result from reports received from commercial 
aircraft flying at high altitude. The beacon could be located anywhere within a large search area.

Reports might also be received via low-flying aircraft and ground stations. The methods that follow 
will help define and reduce beacon search areas. Maximum detection ranges for beacon signals are 
assumed to be limited by line of sight.
3.  Figure S-1 depicts the geometry when an aircraft receives a beacon signal, and shows labelling used in 
planning a search for the beacon. However, potential scenarios discussed in the cautionary notes below

may limit the applicability of figure S-1 and should be taken into account when deemed appropriate.
Cautionary notes
Only a single report and reporting aircraft location might be received. Unless the aircraft can provide 
additional information, the search area would have to be assumed to include the area within a single circle 
centred on the reporting aircraft’s location.
Reports of first heard and last heard information may not be accurate. The person monitoring the radio may

not immediately hear or recognize the 121.5 MHz distress beacon swept tone, causing the reported time and 
location to be incorrect.
• The beacon may have started transmitting after the reporting aircraft was already well within the 
maximum detection range, or the beacon may cease transmitting well before the aircraft is beyond 
the maximum detection range. Try to determine whether the signal: seemed strong when first

acquired and then faded; was getting stronger and then abruptly ceased; or started suddenly, stopped 
suddenly, and seemed to be about the same strength the whole time it was heard. In such cases, 
the search planning procedure in this appendix should still work, although the overlapping area 
where the two circles intersect will be enlarged; the centres of the circles would be closer together 
than they would be if signal acquisition and loss were solely due to the reporting aircraft coming

within and then moving beyond maximum detection range while the beacon was transmitting.
• As a part of the report data gathering process it should also be ascertained that the receiving radio 
was already on (did not receive the signal when it was first turned on) and that detection of the 
signal did not occur while squelch was being adjusted. These situations may occur when seeking 
reports from additional aircraft when they first turn on or adjust their radios to listen. In such cases,

the position for the last heard point could be more useful that the position of when the beacon was 
first heard.
Reports from a single aircraft may occur at different altitudes or courses . Aircraft, particularly those under 
instrument flight rules, may be ascending, descending and/or changing course according to their flight plan 
and air route traffic control needs. The first heard and last heard reports could be from different altitudes or

on different courses. For a course change, knowing the turn point would allow drawing another range circle to 
combine with the first heard and last heard generated range circles to more narrowly define the area. When 
the reports occur at different altitudes, range circles should be drawn for each altitude to identify their intersect 
points.

Appendix S – Search planning for 121.5 MHz distress beacon alerts
S-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
The transmitting beacon antenna may have some height above sea level or above its surrounding terrain . 
The height of the sending antenna should be added to the height of the radio receiver when estimating the 
detection range.
In areas involving an island, the island should be considered as a possible forced landing site . The first

heard and last heard positions may be affected by the forced landing site’s altitude and the terrain surrounding 
the site, which could block the signal in some directions.
The radio horizon range circle may cross land. The altitude of the reporting aircraft should be assumed to be 
the aircraft altitude above that elevation of the terrain at the lowest land horizon rather than above sea level, 
as discussed below in this appendix.

as discussed below in this appendix.
The detected beacon may be aboard an in-flight aircraft, and the aircraft, course, speed or altitude could 
change. The procedures in this appendix do not account for an in-flight beacon scenario, but the search 
planner should be aware that apparently conflicting data or unexpected search planning outcomes could be 
caused by this situation.

4.  Record reported data. Use table S-1 to record data received about a transmitting 121.5 MHz beacon. 
Of all data collected about the beacon signal, the position and height of the receiving antenna for 
points first heard (PFH) and last heard (PLH) are most important.

Note: Obviously, reports from multiple sources can help substantially in narrowing down the search 
area for a 121.5 MHz beacon. The SAR mission coordinator (SMC) should use all reports, and also 
solicit additional reports from other aircraft in the area, either directly or via the appropriate flight 
services as appropriate. Aircraft should be asked to report their own altitudes and positions where

the signal was first heard, when the maximum signals were heard, and when the signal faded or was 
lost. Flight services, communications authorities, maritime SAR authorities or others might also be 
able to obtain fixes or bearings on activated beacons. When receiving multiple reports, consider the 
possibility that more than one activated 121.5 MHz beacon might be heard. The authorities might also 
be able to help locate and silence an inadvertently activated beacon.

5.  Plot the reporting aircraft track. Use a rhumb line or great circle navigation depending on the track 
being followed by the reporting aircraft, as depicted in figure S-2.
  Note: The geographic area used as an example in figures S-2, S-3, S-4, S-5, S-8 and S-10 is Hawaii and 
the surrounding area. The illustration shows a Lockheed C-130 search aircraft from Air Station Barbers 
Point in response to a report from an aircraft at high altitude, but similar plots could be developed for

any area and other situations.

6.  Plot the radio horizons.  Compute and plot the distance to the radio (VHF/UHF) horizon for the

reporting aircraft at PFH and PLH.
(a) The radio horizon distance is estimated using table S-3 at the end of this appendix or by using 
the following equation:
  d = 1.23 x  √
__
 h  
 where:
   h is the antenna height in feet above the water (e.g. mean sea level) or above ground level 
(AGL); and
   d is the radio horizon distance (reception range) for the reporting aircraft in nautical miles 
(NM).

(NM).
(b) Use table S-3 and its associated equations to determine the radio range to the horizon from a 
receiving antenna at various altitudes, where the altitude is measured above mean sea level (MSL)

Appendix S – Search planning for 121.5 MHz distress beacon alerts
S-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
in oceanic environments. If the elevation of the horizon varies in different directions from the 
aircraft, perfect circles will not accurately represent the potential areas containing the beacon. 
The conservative approaches are as follows:
• when the horizon is only partly over an oceanic area, plot a circle using altitude above 
MSL;

MSL;
• when the horizon is entirely over land, use the above ground level (AGL) altitude, where 
AGL is the altitude of the reporting aircraft above the elevation of the horizon at its lowest 
point; and
• be aware that over jungle areas, mountainous terrain, or where similar signal obstructions 
exist, the radio detection range may be as little as one-tenth of the horizon range (in 
mountainous terrain or areas covered with dense vegetation, the range of the signal will be

reduced considerably compared to the range over water or flat land as discussed in section 
5.6 of this Manual).

7.  Plot the intersect line. The circles should intersect in two places. Draw a line between the two 
points where the circles intersect. This line will bisect the line connecting PFH and PLH positions as 
indicated in figure S-4.

8.  Plan the search. With only a single report from a high-flying aircraft and the associated long distances, 
large search areas will result and search options will be limited.
(a) Generally, with a single report, an electronic search will be needed to attempt to reacquire and 
home on the beacon signal. An electronic search can often be accomplished reasonably fast 
with a single aircraft SAR unit (SRU) search track.

(b) The aircraft SRU should proceed to the nearest point where the two circles intersect and then 
fly at a high altitude to the other point where the two circles intersect as illustrated in figure S-5. 
This should allow the beacon signal to be detected so the SRU can home on it.
 Note: The other two legs of the triangle are flight from the base to commence search point (CSP) 
and also return to base from the second intersection point/end of the intersect line.

(c) The area where the two circles overlap could also be covered with a multi-leg track line pattern. 
This might be necessary if the maximum altitude of the SRU limits its detection range to less than 
half the width of the overlapping area of the two circles. A parallel sweep or creeping line search 
pattern could also be used as discussed in section 5.6 of this volume of the IAMSAR Manual.

9.  Reporting aircraft position. When the reporting aircraft passes directly over or nearly over the beacon

position as shown in figure S-6, the search aircraft may proceed along the reporting aircraft’s trackline. 
This special case is indicated when the distance over which the beacon was heard is twice (or nearly 
so) the radio horizon distance (d). However, if the reporting aircraft was not near the beacon position 
and the search aircraft’s altitude is substantially lower than the reporting aircraft’s altitude, a simple

trackline electronic search may provide inadequate coverage to detect the beacon signal.
(a) As shown in figures S-7 and S-8, with the reporting aircraft at 30,000 ft and the search aircraft 
at 10,000 ft, two primary locations would be missed by a search along the reporting aircraft’s 
track; even a search at 20,000 ft would not cover the entire area.
(b) In most situations it would be best to search along the intersect line (figures S-5 and S-9), with 
the search aircraft at 10,000 ft.

the search aircraft at 10,000 ft.
(c) If searching along and perpendicular to the track does not succeed, a decision will be needed 
on if conducting a multiple leg track search is warranted based on all available information.

10.  Visual search. If no beacon signal is detected by the search aircraft conducting an electronic search 
or by other high-flying aircraft, a visual search will usually be impractical based on a single report. 
A visual search may be practical when the report comes from a low-flying aircraft which results in a

smaller search area. If no other information is available besides a single report, the SMC should follow 
the SAR agency’s guidance for responding to uncorrelated reports.
11.  Multiple Reports. Multiple reports make it easier to reduce the area of the probable location for 
the distress beacon. (This situation is very similar to uncorrelated distress calls on VHF-FM and the 
reception by multiple radio towers (without direction finding).)

(a) Plot each report; identify the intersections and areas of overlap of the pairs of radio horizon 
circles; and, eliminate those areas not covered by the multiple reports.
(b) Figure S-10 shows a plot of reports from two aircraft. The first report is from an aircraft at 
30,000 ft on a course of 060 degrees T, and the second report is from a descending aircraft on 
a course of 242 degrees T from 20,000 ft to 10,000 ft when the signal is last heard. (The smaller

search area in this case would reduce the search time needed for an electronic search and could 
result in a reasonable visual search.)

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) U-1
Appendix U
Mobile telecommunications device location process
U1.1 The services available to mobile telecommunications device users utilize terrestrial radio systems 
which are then linked to large computer servers which, amongst other functions, record: activity; 
cell-site to which a user is connected; and general location of the user. This information provides data

which is of use to Search and Rescue authorities who may need to identify the location of persons in 
actual or possible danger, e.g. overdue vessel, aircraft or missing persons on land.
U1.2 Mobile/Cellular telecommunications devices have also become a popular means of reporting 
emergencies either at sea or on land, in the coastal environment and/or other remote areas, 
e.g. swimmers, surfers, overdue hikers, climbers, etc. Leisure boaters, aviators and small fishing craft

might report their emergencies by cell/mobile phone and these devices can often provide an effective 
signal over considerable areas, depending on the location, height and power of the terrestrial aerial 
infrastructure.
U1.3 Survivors from distressed vessels or crashed aircraft may be able to use mobile telecommunications 
devices to call for assistance or their devices may remain switched on and may provide signals that

can be detected by the cell/mobile telecommunications system. The development of procedures to 
exploit location data from these devices to determine survivor location is important for effective SAR 
response, particularly when other sources of location information are not available or are inconsistent 
or inaccurate.
U1.4 This annex is focused on search planning techniques for situations where a mobile telecommunications

device can only be located using the terrestrial radio signal information obtained from the aerial site 
the device was or is connected to. Where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) information is 
available on the location of a mobile telecommunications device (i.e. the user has a GNSS enabled 
device), the SMC may be able to apply normal search planning procedures and techniques to the

GNSS position. However, information on the cell-site signal location may also be a useful confirmation 
of a GNSS position.
U1.5 The processes outlined below are offered as manual search planning processes and do not take into 
account any computerized search planning computer systems or applications.
Mobile telecommunications device location process
U1.6 Mobile telecommunications aerial (cell) sites are commonly fitted with three aerials* (covering 360°

in azimuth) which provide the mast/cell with three communications “sectors” (each of 120° of arc) 
on which mobile/cell phone calls and data traffic can be exchanged or mobile/cell phones/devices 
can be polled.† For SAR purposes this usually means that, as a minimum, a mobile/cell device can be 
located to within a particular aerial site “sector”. This is, essentially, a crude direction-finding method 
but with a large arc of error.

but with a large arc of error.
* This may not be the case globally and some aerial sites have more aerials per mast, e.g. 6.
† Mobile telecommunications systems poll mobile devices on a periodic basis to establish the current location and status of a device. 
When a device is switched on or off or, if a location update has not been received for a set period of time or, a user makes or receives

a call, text, data communication, etc. an update signal is exchanged with the nearest mast. This information is logged by the mobile 
telecommunications company computer servers. Each time a device moves in or out of range of a new aerial/mast, a new polling 
request is exchanged and the phones mast-location and, therefore, its sector, is updated.

Appendix U – Mobile telecommunications device location process 
U-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
U1.6.1 RCCs are recommended to establish what types of systems are in use in their SRRs and ensure that 
they understand the technical processes and how those systems can be used to provide data of use to 
SAR response and search planning.
Figure U-1: A mobile telecommunications mast with three aerials – therefore three “sectors”

U1.7 For 4G-capable mobile phones or devices within coverage of a 4G network cell/tower, mobile 
communications service providers may also be able to provide information on the distance of the 
phone or device from the cell/tower. This then provides the ability to plot an arc within a particular 
aerial site sector.
Mobile telecommunications devices are radio transmitters
U1.8 Mobile telecommunications devices are radio transmitters: this means that the signals behave in a

similar way to VHF radio signals – they tend to work over “line of sight” to and from the aerial/
mast site. The signals can however be distorted, reflected, propagated (by atmospheric conditions 
or their position in relation to bodies of water) or shielded by buildings, passing traffic or terrain. 
This creates a particular problem with emergency calls from mobile telecommunications devices 
in that the communications data might “predict” that a phone is within the coverage of a mobile

telecommunications aerial site but, it can also be the case that the phone or device is connected to 
the aerial from outside the normally predicted coverage.
U1.9 Mobile communications service providers can provide terrain models of each aerial site and these can 
show, in more detail, any masking effects based on transmitter height and terrain contours, buildings, 
etc. between various locations in a cell tower’s coverage area. It can be useful to ask providers to assist

the RCC/MRCC in determining the area where the mobile communications device may be located.
Emergency telephone systems, enhanced call-data
U1.10 Emergency telephone calls from mobile telecommunications emergency (e.g. 112, 999, 911) voice-
calls may be routed through telecommunications systems that are able to automatically provide 
approximate location information to the emergency service operator. These systems usually give a

predicted location area for a phone based on signal strength, aerial site location, transmitter power 
and surrounding terrain, buildings, etc. Such prediction areas are usually provided to emergency 
services in either a circle or an ellipse form, which can be plotted onto a chart or map. In reality they 
can be much more complex shapes depending on the scale of the terrain model used. However, these

areas can be significantly inaccurate given other factors such as propagation, terrain masking, signal 
attenuation, etc. See figure U-5 on page U-6 for diagram.
Cell site information
U1.11 Mobile telecommunications companies can usually provide the following enhanced information 
about an emergency telephone or data call. National legislative procedures and processes may have 
to be followed to enable a RCC/MRCC to obtain such information e.g. such data may not be directly

Appendix U – Mobile telecommunications device location process 
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) U-3
available to SAR coordination services and police or judicial assistance may have to be requested to 
obtain the information due to privacy laws, etc.
a) cell site location – in the national map grid-reference system and/or in latitude and longitude;
b) postal address of the site including the postal or Zip code;
c) time that the information was valid for;

c) time that the information was valid for;
d) whether the information is an incoming or outgoing call, text or data connection or was a polling 
location-update signal;
e) the “sector” on which a mobile telecommunications device was connected or polled – this may 
be in one of two formats:
i) clock face, e.g. 12 o’clock to 5 o’clock;
ii) bearing method, e.g. 060 degrees; and
f) for a 4G device within a 4G network, the distance of the device from the cell site location may 
be available.

be available.
U1.12 The “direction” information needs to be understood and interpreted before it can be used for search 
planning:
a) The clock face method indicates that the sectors are laid out according to the 12 hour clock 
system, with each “hour” representing 30 compass degrees e.g. “sector from 4 o’clock to 
8 o’clock” means from 120 to 240 degrees:
 
 
Cell site 
Clock face
bearing method 
12 o'clock 
4 o'clock 8 o'clock
Figure U-2: Cell site sector, clock face method, three sectors.

Note: 12 o’clock is normally grid north.*
b) The “Bearing” method means the sector is reported as the centre line of a 120 degree-wide 
sector, e.g. “sector bearing 060” means that the sector is from 000 degrees to 120 degrees 
(assuming site North is 000 degrees map grid North); 60 degrees must be added and subtracted 
from the given bearing to provide the aerial “sector”. This assumes a three-aerial mast.

* The orientation of a cell site compass direction must also be established, e.g. Grid North, True North, Magnetic North. This must 
then be applied to any search plan.

U1.13 The process of plotting and creating a (crude) manual search area from either “sector” format is to:
a) plot the location of the aerial site on a map or chart;

b) draw on the chart the sector bearing lines from the cell site to the maximum range that the cell 
site is predicted to cover, e.g. 10 kilometres;
c) scribe an arc, between the bearing lines, centred on the aerial site location to the maximum 
range the site can cover. This shape will look like a large cake slice;
d) enclose the “cake slice” within a box;
e) calculate an appropriate Datum Time;

e) calculate an appropriate Datum Time;
f) if the incident is over land, this area is now your search area. It may be necessary to move this 
area in accordance with estimated or likely movement if the survivors are known to be moving, 
e.g. walking;
g) for an aircraft, if the planned route is known, this may also be plotted to further reduce the 
search area;
h) if the incident is maritime, drift each corner of this box according to the appropriate tide/current(s)

near to each corner (any corners “on land” will have to be drifted in approximation to the nearest 
coastal tides and currents);
i) add estimated, or known, leeway of the search object to the drift of each corner of the box;
j) increase the size of the search box in accordance with assessed Drift Error factor percentage. 
This can be done by expanding the sides of the box by the amount calculated. The final area is 
the search area; and

the search area; and
k) manually calculate Search Area Coverage for assigned SRUs.
U1.14 It should be noted that “drifting” corners is not always adequate. For example: This would not work 
very well in areas with a high current gradient, such as some bays, inlets, straits, etc. and the four 
corners of a box may not include a strong current in the middle, for example. The drift start points 
should be based on the best available knowledge of the local currents and winds to ensure a proper

representation of possible drift trajectories.

may provide clues to its location.
U1.19 For example, an overdue vessel or aircraft is known to have set off on a route, travelling from north to 
south, between two places, but there is a large distance between them. The SMC wishes to reduce the 
size of the search area and obtains mobile telecommunications device data that indicates the vessel or 
aircraft had received a telephone call off a certain part of a coastline. This information can be plotted

to provide the SMC with a Last Known Position from which to create a Datum Line search plan for the 
rest of the route.

Appendix U – Mobile telecommunications device location process 
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) U-7
U1.20 The process explained in paragraph 12 above can be applied to develop a search area from this initial 
cell site information. Once this is done, normal Datum Line search planning processes (manual or 
computerized) can then be used to calculate a Datum Line search area along the rest of the vessel or 
aircraft’s estimated route.

U1.21 The Initial Position Error (IPE) is determined by measuring the largest distance across the “sector”. 
A position in the middle of the “sector” should be chosen as the Drift Start Position (DSP) and the IPE 
then applied to this position.
U1.22 The same process could be used for land incidents to determine the LKP of missing hikers, aircraft, 
vehicles, etc. on planned or known routes.

U1.23 It should be noted that a mobile communications device and mobile telecommunications aerial data 
constitute only one line of evidence about the vessel’s position at the time of the call. Other lines of

evidence include nautical chart information, especially data on soundings, aids to navigation, hazards 
to navigation, etc., along with any available information about the vessel’s intended route, destination, 
experience, qualifications, predilections of the vessel’s captain, etc. All of this information should be 
considered when estimating the most probable position at the time of the last communication, the

probable error of that position and the most probable track(s) and speed(s) of advance thereafter.

To help reduce the size of the Datum Line Search Area,

U1.24 Mobile telecommunications device data can also provide RCCs with useful location information for 
overdue persons, vehicles or aircraft. Although mobile telecommunications devices may not be in 
use while an aircraft is in the air, it may be that persons on board use, or try to use, their cell/mobile

phones once an aircraft has force landed or, that mobile telecommunications devices are or become 
active at a crash or forced landing site. Light aircraft users may also leave cell/mobile devices switched 
on in flight and this may provide useful SAR clues if an aircraft is reported overdue or missing.
U1.25 In these scenarios, location data from these devices may assist SAR units and teams to locate a missing 
aircraft.

U1.26 It should be noted again that a cell-site signal propagation “map” for the cell-site tower, based on 
terrain and height of the mobile telecommunications devices above ground level, will be useful to 
help the search planner create a more accurate search area. Unless aircraft was airborne and moving 
at the time.

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION) V-3
Introduction 
1 The Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS) was established to mitigate challenges 
in the global air navigation system, regarding the timely identification and localization of aircraft 
in distress, such as those that occurred with the accidents of Air France flight AF447 and Malaysia 
Airlines flight MH370.

Airlines flight MH370. 
2 GADSS provides an effective and globally consistent approach to enhancing the alerting procedures 
of search and rescue services by addressing a number of key improvement areas. 
3 In order to achieve these improvements, GADSS contains three main elements:  
.1 aircraft tracking;  
.2 location of an aircraft in distress (achieved through autonomous distress tracking (ADT) of aircraft 
in flight); and 
.3 post-flight localization and recovery (PFLR).

.3 post-flight localization and recovery (PFLR). 
4 Utilizing these elements, GADSS ensures an up-to-date record of aircraft progress is maintained and, 
in case of a crash, forced landing or ditching, ensures information on the location of survivors, the 
aircraft and recoverable flight data is available.  
5 For GADSS to function as intended, flight crew and aircraft operators, air traffic controllers and air

navigation services providers (ANSPs), ADT service providers, and rescue coordination centres (RCCs) 
need to understand each other’s roles, responsibilities and processes to ensure effective communication, 
robust coordination and harmonized implementation across the globe.  
6 This document, however, provides guidance to these entities specifically on the implementation of 
3.2 regarding the location of an aircraft in distress aspect of GADSS, in order to assist with the

development of each entity’s procedures, so as to be compliant with the ICAO standards concerned.  
7 The Standard defining location of an aircraft in distress * requires that, as of 1 January 2023, aircraft 
issued with a certificate of airworthiness for the first time, with a maximum certificated take-off mass 
of over 27 000 kg, “shall autonomously transmit information from which a position can be determined

by the operator at least once every minute, when in distress.” The ICAO provisions also recommend 
that this requirement be applied to aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass of over 5 700 kg.  
8 An aircraft is in a distress condition when it is in a state that, if the aircraft behaviour event is left 
uncorrected, can result in an accident. EUROCAE document ED-237 Minimum Aviation System

Performance Specification for Criteria to Detect In-Flight Aircraft Distress Events to Trigger Transmission 
of Flight Information sets out criteria to measure such behaviour events and determine when activation 
of ADT devices is required.  
9 The key entities involved in implementation of the location of aircraft in distress are:  
.1 aircraft operators (airline companies and aircraft owners; not the flight crew); 
.2 ADT service providers;  
.3 ANSPs; and  
.4 RCCs.

.3 ANSPs; and  
.4 RCCs. 
Autonomous distress tracking 
10 Several significant functional requirements are necessary to permit the effective implementation of 
autonomous distress tracking of aircraft in flight, including: 
.1 detection of a distress condition; 
.2 autonomous transmission of information from which a position can be determined, including 
a time stamp. This could take the form of, inter alia, transmitted GNSS coordinates, or a radio

* Annex 6 — Operation of Aircraft, part I — International Commercial Air Transport — Aeroplanes, paragraph 6.18.

Appendix V – Autonomous distress tracking of aircraft in flight 
V-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
signal which can be triangulated. The system used for this transmission shall be capable of 
transmitting the information in the event of aircraft electrical power loss, at least for the expected 
duration of the entire flight;  
.3 a means for the aircraft operator to receive such transmitted position information;

.4 validation by the aircraft operator of the distress condition (i.e. it is valid and not the result of a 
faulty ADT device or some other reason) to avoid unnecessary burdens to SAR services; and 
.5 a means for the aircraft operator to make the position information of a flight in distress available 
to the appropriate organizations, as established by the State of the Operator.  
11 A simplified schematic timeline for an emergency situation is shown in figure V-1 to illustrate the

sequence of events occurring when an ADT device is activated.  
12 The initial autonomous transmission by the aircraft should commence no later than five seconds after 
the detection of the activation event. Pilots may also manually activate an ADT device.  
13 An ADT device can only be deactivated by the same mechanism that activated it (i.e. when an ADT 
device is manually activated, only the flight crew can manually deactivate it; when an ADT device is

automatically activated, it can only be automatically deactivated). 
14 Activation of an ADT device does not constitute an emergency requiring SAR services to be alerted. 
Such activation, which may result from a situation recoverable by the flight crew, is instead deemed a 
notification. The validation of the activation is further described below in paragraph 22.  
15 The ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) related to ADT devices are not technology-

specific; aircraft operators may select the device most suited to their operations. While multiple systems 
which meet the requirements of the SARPs are available, RCCs should note that there exists one 
system which behaves differently from the others in one significant aspect. Utilizing their existing data 
distribution network, as well as the LADR process described herein, Cospas-Sarsat has developed a

system which will deliver ADT notifications to RCCs via both LADR and SIT185 messages. This system 
is described in Attachment A. 
Location of an aircraft in distress repository (LADR) 
16 The LADR, a secure storage facility with a web-based viewer, collects, stores and makes available 
(to subscription holders) position information supplied from ADT devices, so that operators can 
comply with ICAO annex 6 – Operation of Aircraft, part I – International Commercial Air Transport –

Aeroplanes, paragraph 6.18.3.  
17 The information stored by the LADR includes, as a minimum, last known position of an aircraft 
in distress (latitude and longitude), date and time of transmission of information, date and time of 
receipt of information, and aircraft identification information (one or more of aircraft registration, call 
sign, aircraft address (24-bit), and SELCAL (Selective calling) code). Operators may also submit other

information, inter alia, level (recommended to be included), accuracy of position data, heading, and 
airspeed.* The availability of this information in the LADR will fulfil the requirement of .3 and .5 of 
paragraph 10, thereby enhancing SAR and recovery capabilities. 
18  ICAO will act as the LADR Administrator, and ensure only appropriate entities, such as ADT service 
providers, RCCs, area control centres (ACCs), or aircraft operators concerned, can gain access to, or

deposit data in, the LADR. RCCs will be granted access to all data. ACCs will be granted access to 
data related to locations within their FIR, and the surrounding 80 nautical miles (to allow them to 
be informed on events close to, or about to enter, their FIR, which could have an impact on their 
operations, and to allow for the possibility that position inaccuracy might show the aircraft in an

adjacent FIR). Aircraft operators will be granted access only to data related to their own aircraft, 
* The full list of mandatory and optional data elements is published in the LADR Functional Specification and can be accessed at 
https://www.icao.int/safety/globaltracking/Documents.

19 Appropriate entities will be able to request a free subscription to the LADR through the ICAO OPS

Control Directory (OPS CTRL), which can be accessed at: www.icao.int/safety/globaltracking. Both 
systems will use the ICAO Data Network for Aviation (DNA) for authentication and single sign-in. 
20 LADR subscribers can elect to receive a notification whenever new ADT information relevant to them 
arrives in the LADR. LADR subscribers will then need to look in the LADR to access the ADT data. 
LADR data users will have read-only access to available information according to their profile.

Appendix V – Autonomous distress tracking of aircraft in flight 
V-6 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME II (2022 EDITION)
21 Subscribing to the LADR is voluntary for all entities other than aircraft operators, who will need to 
subscribe in order to “ensure that the location of an aircraft in distress repository (LADR) is automatically 
updated with autonomous distress tracking (ADT) data from an aircraft in a distress condition” (Doc 8168,

Procedures for Air Navigation Services – Aircraft Operations, volume III – Aircraft Operating Procedures, 
section 10, chapter 2). However, RCCs are strongly encouraged to subscribe in order to have access to 
up-to-date and accurate position information of aircraft potentially in distress.  
Aircraft operator 
22 Upon receipt of notification of an ADT device activation, the aircraft operator is responsible for

validating the cause of the activation. There are three possible outcomes from this activity: 
.1 aircraft operator finds the activation to be invalid, or no longer valid, i.e. confirms there was a 
‘false alarm’, or that the flight crew has recovered the aircraft from the distress condition; 
.2 aircraft operator finds the activation to be valid, i.e. confirms the aircraft is in distress; or

.3 aircraft operator is uncertain whether the activation is valid or invalid (for example, is unable to 
contact the flight crew), in which case a valid activation must be assumed. 
23 Several means of validation of an activation can be utilized, including but not limited to voice 
communications with the flight crew, data link communications, and observation of flight tracking 
data.  
24 As per the responsibilities outlined in ICAO annex 6 – Operation of Aircraft , part I – International

Commercial Air Transport – Aeroplanes, appendix 9, the aircraft operator will inform the appropriate 
area control centre if there is reason to believe that the aircraft is in distress. This could be due to a 
confirmation of the validity of the activation, or inability to contact the crew to validate the nature of 
the activation. Contact details for area control centres can be obtained from the ICAO OPS Control

Directory (OPS CTRL), which can be accessed at: www.icao.int/safety/globaltracking. Access to data 
is governed by user profiles, in line with those for the LADR.  
Area control centre 
25 The appropriate area control centre will record all information relevant to the state of emergency of 
the aircraft, including the outcome of actions taken under paragraph 22, and forward such information 
to the appropriate RCC in accordance with the uncertainty, alert and distress phases, as per ICAO

annex 11 – Air Traffic Services, chapter 5, paragraph 5.2. 
26 It is possible that the appropriate ACC and/or RCC will already be aware of a distress condition by 
means other than the LADR (via a MAYDAY transmission for instance) and appropriate action may 
already have commenced.  
Other points to note 
27 ICAO annex 6 – Operation of Aircraft, part I – International Commercial Air Transport – Aeroplanes was

amended to allow an ADT device to replace the automatic ELT. Consequently, after 1 January 2023, 
some aircraft may no longer automatically transmit a 121.5 MHz homing signal. An ADT device is not 
required to have a homing transmitter. 
28 The ICAO SARPs apply only to aircraft for which an individual certificate of airworthiness is first 
issued on or after 1 January 2023. However, operators have the option to retrofit older aircraft, thereby 
avoiding the need to equip with an automatic ELT.

Attachment A 
Utilizing ELT(DT) to locate aircraft in distress
1 The International Cospas-Sarsat Programme is a satellite-aided search and rescue initiative organized 
as a treaty-based, non-profit, intergovernmental, humanitarian cooperative of 45 States and agencies. 
Conceived and initiated by Canada, France, the United States, and the former Soviet Union in 1979,

it is dedicated to detecting and locating radio beacons activated by persons, aircraft or vessels in 
distress, and forwarding this alert information to authorities that can take action for rescue.  
2 The Cospas-Sarsat System utilizes a network of satellites that provides global coverage. Distress 
alerts are detected, located and forwarded to over 200 countries and territories at no cost to beacon

owners or the receiving government agencies. Since the first rescue using Cospas-Sarsat technology 
in September 1982, the Cospas-Sarsat System has provided assistance in rescuing more than 50,000 
persons in more than 15,000 SAR events. 
3 Specifications for the Distress Tracking ELT (ELT(DT)) have been developed by the International 
Cospas-Sarsat Programme. These specifications allow aircraft operators to comply with the ICAO

provisions by utilizing either manual activation of the ELT(DT) by flight crew, or automatic activation 
of the ELT(DT) when a distress condition is detected. 
4 Notification of the activation of the ELT(DT) and other associated information will be automatically 
transmitted via the Cospas-Sarsat Space and Ground Segments directly to relevant RCCs, and 
automatically sent to the LADR. This dual delivery differs from other ADT system and may result in

RCCs being notified of the same event by multiple means.  
5 As well as the standard information transmitted in any ELT alert, Cospas-Sarsat will include in the 
ELT(DT) message sent to RCCs and the LADR the three letter designator for the aircraft operating 
agency, aircraft position and level, and whether the device was triggered manually or automatically, 
in compliance with the specifications of the LADR. The age of the latest position report received will

also be provided; e.g. “position 23-34.44N 070-33.55W is less than 1 minute old”.* 
6 ELT(DT)s operate using aircraft power, with an independent backup power supply in case of aircraft 
electrical failure. The specified duration of autonomous operation of ELT(DT) is a minimum of 
370 minutes while using an independent power supply, and it will transmit a message with encoded 
location information at the following intervals: 
.1 every 5 seconds for the first 2 minutes following activation;

.2 every 10 seconds after 2 minutes until 5 minutes following activation; and 
.3 every 30 seconds after 5 minutes following activation.  
7 An ELT(DT) may also include the following capabilities: 
.1 for an ELT(DT) that is crash survivable, sufficient battery life to provide 24 hours of 406 MHz 
message transmissions, and 48 hours of 121.5 MHz direction-finding signal transmissions; or  
.2 for an ELT(DT) combined with the function of an ELT(AF) (automatic fixed), an ELT(AP) (automatic

portable), or an ELT(AD) (automatic deployable), sufficient battery life to provide 24 hours plus 
370 minutes of 406 MHz message transmissions, and 48 hours of 121.5 MHz direction-finding 
signal transmissions.
* Cospas-Sarsat Document C/S A.002, “Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description” provides sample 
ELT(DT) alert and cancellation messages.

Foreword
The primary purpose of the Mobile Facilities volume (volume III) of the 
International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual 
(IAMSAR Manual) is to assist vessels and aircraft in the performance of a 
search, rescue or on-scene coordinator function and with aspects of search 
and rescue (SAR) that pertain to their own emergencies. It is intended to be 
carried on board rescue units, aircraft and vessels.

A new edition is published every three years. The 2022 edition includes 
the amendments, approved by the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) and the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) at its 103rd session in May 2021 by means of 
MSC.1/Circ.1640, which become applicable on 1 June 2022. The amendments 
were prepared by the ICAO/IMO Joint Working Group on Harmonization of 
Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue at its 27th meeting.

The Manual is published jointly by the International Civil Aviation 
Organization and the International Maritime Organization.
The IAMSAR Manual is subject to copyright protection under ICAO and 
IMO. However, limited reproducing of forms, checklists, tables, graphs and 
similar content is allowed for operational or training use.
Each IAMSAR Manual volume is written with specific SAR system duties in 
mind, and can be used as a stand-alone document or, in conjunction with

the other two volumes, as a means to attain a full view of the SAR system. 
Depending on the duties assigned, it may be necessary to hold only one or 
two, or all three volumes.
• The Organization and Management  volume (volume I) discusses the 
global SAR system concept, establishment and improvement of national 
and regional SAR systems, and cooperation with neighbouring States to 
provide effective and economical SAR services;

Purpose
The purpose of the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and 
Rescue Manual for Mobile Facilities, which is intended for carriage on board 
search and rescue units, and on board civil aircraft and vessels, is to provide 
guidance to those who:
• operate aircraft, vessels or other craft, and who may be called upon 
to use the facility to support SAR operations
• may need to perform on-scene coordinator functions for multiple 
facilities in the vicinity of a distress situation

• experience actual or potential emergencies, and may require search 
and rescue (SAR) assistance.
Responsibilities and obligations to assist
Under long-standing traditions of the sea and various provisions of 
international law, ship masters are obligated to assist others in distress at sea 
whenever they can safely do so.
The responsibilities to render assistance to a distressed vessel or aircraft 
are based on humanitarian considerations and established international

practice. Specific obligations can be found in several conventions, including 
the following:
• Annex 12 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation
• International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue
• Regulation V/33 of the International Convention for the Safety of 
Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS 1974). (See appendix A).

Section 1 – Overview of the SAR system
1-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
On-scene coordinator
• When two or more SAR facilities are working together on the same 
mission, one person on scene may be needed to coordinate the activities 
of all participating facilities.
 F The SMC designates an OSC, who may be the person in charge 
of a:
 – search and rescue unit (SRU), ship, or aircraft participating in 
a search; or
 – nearby facility in a position to handle OSC duties.

F The person in charge of the first facility to arrive at the scene will 
normally assume the OSC function until the SMC arranges for that 
person to be relieved.
SAR mission coordinator
• Each SAR operation is carried out under the guidance of an SMC. This 
function exists only for the duration of a specific SAR incident and is 
normally performed by the RCC chief or a designee. The SMC may have 
assisting staff.
• The SMC guides a SAR operation until a rescue has been effected or it

becomes apparent that further efforts would be of no avail.
• The SMC should be well trained in all SAR processes, be thoroughly 
familiar with the applicable SAR plans, and:
 F gather information about distress situations
 F develop accurate and workable SAR action plans
 F dispatch and coordinate the resources to carry out SAR missions.
• SMC duties include:
 F obtain and evaluate all data on the emergency
 F ascertain the type of emergency equipment carried by the missing

or distressed craft
 F remain informed of prevailing environmental conditions
 F if necessary, ascertain movements and locations of vessels and alert 
shipping in likely search areas for rescue, lookout and/or radio watch
 F plot the areas to search and decide on methods and facilities to be 
used
 F develop the search action plan and rescue action plan as appropriate
 F coordinate the operation with adjacent RCCs when appropriate
 F arrange briefing and debriefing of SAR personnel

one or more persons or agencies for whom this designation may be 
appropriate.
• SCs have the overall responsibility for:
 F establishing, staffing, equipping and managing the SAR system
 F establishing RCCs and rescue sub-centres (RSCs)

F providing or arranging for SAR facilities
 F coordinating SAR training
 F developing SAR policies.
National and regional SAR system organization
Many States have accepted the obligation to provide aeronautical and 
maritime SAR coordination and services on a 24-hour basis for their 
territories, territorial seas, and where appropriate, the high seas.
• To carry out these responsibilities, States have established national SAR

organizations, or joined one or more other States to form a regional SAR 
organization associated with an ocean area or continent.

or vessel.
• A ship reporting system enables the SMC to quickly:
 F identify vessels in the vicinity of a distress situation, along with their 
positions, courses, and speeds
 F be aware of other information about the vessels which may be 
valuable (whether a doctor is on board, etc.)
 F know how to contact the vessels
 F improve the likelihood of rapid aid during emergencies

F reduce the number of calls for assistance to vessels unfavourably 
located to respond
 F reduce the response time to provide assistance.
• Masters of vessels are urged or mandated to send regular reports to the 
authority operating a ship reporting system for SAR and other safety-
related services.
• Additional information on operators of ship reporting systems may be 
obtained from RCCs.
• Automatic identification system (AIS) and long-range identification and

tracking (LRIT) transmissions are also important for providing shore 
authorities with real or near real time vessel tracking data to support 
search and rescue.

• A pilot-in-command or a master in a distress situation should declare a 
distress condition using the MAYDAY signal.

Section 2 – Distress alerts and messages
2-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
• Basic spoken radio procedural words which SAR personnel should 
understand and use are as follows:
 F AFFIRMATIVE/AFFIRM means that what a person has transmitted 
is correct
 F BREAK is used to separate portions of a message or one message 
from another
 F FIGURES is spoken just before numbers are given in a message
 F I SPELL is used just before a phonetic spelling, such as of a proper 
name

name
 F NEGATIVE means “no”
 F OUT indicates the end of a transmission when no reply is expected 
or required
 F OVER indicates the end of a transmission when an immediate reply 
is expected
 F ROGER means “I have received your transmission satisfactorily”
 F SILENCE (pronounced SEE LONSS) is said three times and means 
“cease all transmissions immediately”
 F SILENCE FINI (pronounced SEE LONSS FEE NEE) means “silence 
is lifted”, and is used to signify the end of the emergency and

resumption of normal traffic
 F THIS IS said before the station name or call sign (C/S) which 
immediately follows
 F WAIT/STAND BY means “I must pause for a few seconds; stand by 
for further transmission”.
• For a more detailed listing of procedural words to use, refer to the 
International Code of Signals (INTERCO).
EPIRBs, ELTs and PLBs
• EPIRB: an EPIRB transmits a signal that alerts SAR authorities and allows 
rescue facilities to home in on the distressed vessel. It is activated

automatically upon exposure to the sea, or manually. 406 MHz EPIRBs 
use Cospas-Sarsat satellites and are required on board certain vessels. 
EPIRBs installed on or after 1 July 2022 will need to be provided with an 
automatic identification system (AIS) locating signal. 
• ELT: most civil aircraft carry one of two types of ELT to alert SAR 
authorities to a distress situation.
 F 406 MHz ELT for use with Cospas-Sarsat satellites, required on 
aircraft on international flights

aircraft on international flights
 F 121.5 MHz ELT might be allowed/required on domestic flights and 
is intended to be heard by other aircraft.
• PLB: the 406 MHz PLB is not a mandated international carriage 
requirement, but may be carried on a person and has similar 
characteristics to EPIRBs and ELTs.
• Cospas-Sarsat calculates position information for the 406 MHz distress 
beacons.
• Most ELTs, EPIRBs and PLBs provide homing signals on 121.5 MHz;

some also use 243 MHz and some EPIRBs may also integrate SARTs into 
their designs.
• Most EPIRBs and all ELTs are designed to activate automatically when a 
vessel sinks or an aircraft crashes (EPIRB alerts tell whether the beacon 
was activated automatically or manually).
• Some ELTs, EPIRBs and PLBs may also have integral GPS capabilities.
• The followings steps should be followed when a distress beacon is 
inadvertently activated:
 F switch the distress beacon OFF; and

F switch the distress beacon OFF; and
 F immediately attempt to notify an RCC that the alert is false.
In cases were the beacon cannot be turned OFF, take measures to prevent or 
inhibit transmission of signal (e.g. shielding of transmission, battery removal, 
etc.). Such actions may prevent future use of the distress beacon.
Note: there is no penalty for inadvertent activation of a distress beacon.
121�5 MHz distress beacon alerts

121�5 MHz distress beacon alerts
• 121.5 MHz distress beacons are still in use and send out distress alerts 
heard on the radio as a WOW WOW sound of two alternating tones.
• Aircraft in flight are the primary means of detecting these alerts. Pilots-
in-command should advise ATS units when this distress alert is heard.
• When in flight and reporting an alert from a 121.5 MHz distress beacon, 
the pilot-in-command should expect the ATS unit to request the 
following information:

 F two-way VHF radio-telephone apparatus and survival craft radar 
transponders to be placed on each side of the vessel, in a position 
ready to be taken on board a survival craft, and one of the following:

– a radar SART which, after being switched on manually and 
triggered by radar(s) in its vicinity, automatically sends out a 
series of pulses which are displayed on a radar screen as a 
series of elongated pips, similar to a radar responder beacon 
(racon) pip, or
 – an AIS search and rescue transmitter (AIS-SART) which, after 
being switched on manually, automatically sends updated 
position reports using a standard AIS class A/B position report. 
An AIS-SART has a built-in GNSS receiver.

Distress alert from a vessel
• Use any of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) 
equipment  to transmit a distress alert:
 F Distress call from a ship earth station using an IMO-recognized 
mobile satellite service 
 F VHF channel 16 (156.8 MHz FM)
 F DSC on (VHF/MF or HF)
 F EPIRB
 – any distress transmissions on VHF channel 16 or 2,182 kHz 
could be preceded by a digital selective call.

could be preceded by a digital selective call.
 – in remote ocean areas, the distress call should also be 
transmitted on a ship-to-shore HF circuit to a CRS, especially 
when distress calls on 2,182 kHz, or channel 16 are not replied 
to by other stations.
• Should there be doubt concerning the reception of the distress message, 
it should also be transmitted on any frequency available on which 
attention might be attracted, such as an inter-ship frequency which may

be in use in the local area.
• Before changing frequency, however, adequate time should be allowed 
for reply.
• In the event of failure of the ship’s radio station, it may be possible 
to transmit a message using portable equipment, provided for use in 
survival craft.
Vessel distress message
• Important components of the distress message include:
 F distress signal “MAYDAY” 
 F name of the vessel in distress 
 F call sign or other identification

F call sign or other identification 
 F MMSI (if the initial alert has been sent by DSC) 
 F position, given as latitude and longitude, or if this is not known or 
if time is insufficient, in relation to a known geographical location 
 F nature of the distress 
 F kind of assistance required 
 F any other useful information; for example: 
 – weather in immediate vicinity, wind direction, sea and swell, 
visibility
 – time of abandoning ship
 – number of crew remaining on board (total/POB)

– number of crew remaining on board (total/POB)
 – number and type of survival craft launched
 – emergency location aids in survival craft or in the sea
 – number of seriously injured.
• Include as much of the above information as practical in the initial 
distress message.
• The timing of subsequent transmissions will be governed by 
circumstances.
• In general, if time allows, a series of short messages will be preferable to 
one or two long ones.

Aircraft distress message

Aircraft distress message
• An emergency can be either a DISTRESS or an URGENCY condition.
Distress
 F Begin initial communication with the word “MAYDAY”, repeated 
three times.
Urgency
 F Begin initial communication with the word “PAN-PAN”, repeated 
three times.
• Specific procedures in handling emergency situations cannot be 
prescribed due to the variety of possible emergency situations.
 F The flight operations manual for the specific type of aircraft is the

best source of guidance and should be carried on board.
Aircraft pilot distress message checklist
• When reporting an in-flight emergency, the pilot-in-command should 
expect the ATS unit to request the following information:
 F aircraft identification and type
 F nature of the emergency
 F pilot’s desires or intentions
 F pilot should also include:
 – aircraft altitude
 – fuel remaining, in hours and minutes
 – pilot-reported weather
 – pilot capability for instrument flight rules (IFR) flight

– time and place of last known position (LKP)
 – heading since last known position
 – airspeed
 – navigation equipment capability
 – NAVAID signals received
 – visible landmarks
 – aircraft colour
 – number of persons on board
 – point of departure and destination
 – emergency equipment on board.
Transmission of the distress message
• When an aircraft transmits a distress message by radio, the first 
transmission is generally made on the designated air–ground en-route

frequency in use between the aircraft and an ATS unit.
 F Although 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz are emergency frequencies, 
the aircraft will usually be kept on the initial contact frequency.
 F Change frequencies only when there is a valid reason.
• In an emergency, the aircraft may use any other available frequency to 
establish contact with any land, mobile, or DF station.
• SAR organizations ordinarily will inform merchant ships of aircraft 
emergencies at sea.
Cancellation of distress message

Cancellation of distress message
• Cancellation should occur as soon as the distressed craft has been 
recovered or when the assistance of SAR facilities is no longer required.
• Any false alert, including by inadvertent human error, should be 
cancelled so that SAR authorities do not needlessly respond.
Vessel and aircraft actions on observing AIS-SART  
or AIS-MOB device signals
• Vessels at sea may observe AIS-SART or AIS-MOB signals on navigation

displays. Although AIS-SARTs and AIS-MOB are locating signals, these 
signals may be related to a vessel or craft that has activated a device 
to draw attention to its location due to a distress situation and this 
should be investigated by RCCs. Therefore, AIS-SART and AIS-MOB 
transmissions should not normally be ignored unless information is

available that confirms that no response is necessary, e.g. it is known to 
be a false alarm.
• The majority of vessels will have AIS directly linked to the electronic 
charting system which means that the SART should automatically be 
displayed on the navigation display.
• It is recommended that any vessel at sea or aircraft that observes 
AIS-SART or AIS-MOB signals should report this to the nearest RCC

immediately. The RCC will then take appropriate actions.
• Vessels or aircraft should also be prepared to proceed to the location of 
the AIS-SART or AIS-MOB signal, if it is safe to do so, to assist the RCC 
in investigating the transmission. As AIS-SART and AIS-MOB signals are 
likely to transmit over relativity short distances, e.g. up to 10  NM, a 
vessel should not be significantly delayed by doing this.

 F pirates are detected by shipboard personnel prior to boarding of 
the vessel
 F pirates board unnoticed, taking hostages and making threats of 
violence or death to the vessel’s crew.

violence or death to the vessel’s crew.
• Pirates normally order the vessel not to make any radio transmissions, 
with further threats of violence.
Pirates detected prior to boarding of the vessel
• Providing the vessel has not been ordered by the pirates to maintain 
radio silence, contact should immediately be made with vessels in 
the vicinity and shore authorities by sending a “piracy/armed robbery 
attack” message through Inmarsat or on an available DSC or other

distress and safety frequency.
Pirates board unnoticed
• A vessel should comply with any order by pirates or armed robbers 
not to make any form of transmission informing shore authorities of 
the attack. Pirates may carry equipment capable of detecting terrestrial 
radio signals.
 F a recommended alternative in this scenario is for the alarm signal 
to be automatically made through satellite so as not to be detected

 F the alarm signal should be made through Inmarsat by using the 
Inmarsat-C “piracy/armed robbery attack” message along with the 
vessel’s current position.
• This message should be activated by means of concealed push buttons 
located in at least three separate locations on the vessel

• To avoid false alerts there should be a coded sequence of operation of 
the push button which will require deliberate action to activate it. This 
system will:
 F leave the pirates unaware that a message has been transmitted
 F provide early warning to shore authorities that an attack is in 
progress and may deter future attacks.

misjudging the altitude, stalling the aircraft, and entering the water 
in a disastrous nose-down attitude.
 F the proper use of power on the approach is extremely important
 F if power is available on one side only, a little power should be used

to flatten the approach; a balance will need to be achieved between 
the need to impact the water as slowly as possible and the loss 
of control that can occur with sudden application of unbalanced 
power at an airspeed near the stall.

 F the pilot should observe the sea surface ahead
 F shadows and whitecaps close together indicate that the seas are 
short and rough
 F touchdown in those areas should be avoided

F touchdown in those areas should be avoided
 F touchdown should be in an area (only about 150 m is needed) 
where the shadows and whitecaps are not so numerous.

Surface craft assistance
• If an aircraft has to ditch, or the crew bail out over water, the most 
advantageous place is near a surface craft, preferably alongside and 
slightly ahead.
• Assistance that might be provided in a ditching situation includes:
 F establishing and maintaining communications with the aircraft. See 
section 8.
 – every effort should be made to establish direct voice

communication between the ship and distressed aircraft
 – a lost-contact procedure should be arranged in the event that 
contact is lost
 F locating the aircraft. The ship may locate the aircraft by:
 Radar
 – standard procedure is for the distressed aircraft to put its 
transponder on Code 7700
 – the pilot may be able to make a 90° identification turn
 – the pilot should hold the new course for three minutes and 
then return to base course
 Homing signals

then return to base course
 Homing signals
 – if the ship can send homing signals on a frequency compatible 
with the aircraft’s automatic direction finder, the pilot may be 
able to provide a reciprocal bearing
 Shore-based assistance
 – authorities may be able to provide a position on the aircraft 
from DF stations or other available information
 Aircraft’s navigational data
 – the pilot may be able to give a position from navigational data
 Weather data

Weather data
 – unusual weather conditions reported by the pilot may give 
clues about the aircraft’s position.
• Vectoring or assisting in homing the aircraft to the ship.
 F a ship may assist an aircraft by providing a homing signal or course 
to steer based on radar or DF bearings from the ship
 F during daylight, a ship may make black smoke, cruise at high speeds 
to form a wake, or use other means to attract attention visually

Section 5 – Aircraft emergencies
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION) 5-9
 F at night, star shells, searchlights, pyrotechnics, deck lights, or water 
lights may be used.
• Providing weather, sea information, and recommended ditching heading.
• Final determination of the ditching heading is the responsibility of the 
pilot, who should inform the ship of the selected ditching heading as 
soon as possible.
• Marking the sea lane along the selected ditching heading.

F during daylight, with relatively calm sea conditions, a ship may 
mark the sea lane with fire-extinguisher foam
 F at night, or during a low-visibility daytime ditching, a ship may lay a 
series of floating lights along the selected ditching heading.
• Providing approach assistance:
 F approach may be made visually, by DF using the homing signals 
from the ship, by radar assistance from the ship, or by a combination 
of these
 F the ship will normally be to one side of the sea lane

F under visual conditions, day or night, the aircraft should make a 
visual approach
 F during low ceiling or poor visibility, a ship may provide continuous 
homing signals through the final approach
 F it may also operate air navigation aids to allow an instrument 
approach
 F the pilot should be aware of the height of the masts on the ship and 
must allow some deviation on final approach in order not to collide 
with the ship

with the ship
 F if the pilot desires, and radar contact is held by the ship, it may give 
radar ranges
 F full radar-controlled approach should not be attempted unless the 
ship is qualified in such approaches.
• Providing illumination:
 F ships with flare or star-shell capability can provide illumination at 
night for a visual approach
 F illumination may be placed over the ditching location and over-shoot 
area, approximately 1,200 m (4,000 ft) past the end of the sea lane

F the ship may also fire an orientation flare when the pilot begins the 
approach.

Section 5 – Aircraft emergencies
5-10 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
• Aircraft usually sink quickly, within minutes. Vessels will often be the 
rescue facility.
• When an aircraft decides to ditch in the vicinity of a ship, the ship should:
 F transmit homing bearings to the aircraft
 F transmit signals enabling the aircraft to take its own bearings
 F by day, make black smoke
 F by night, direct a searchlight vertically and turn on all deck lights

(care must be taken NOT to direct a searchlight towards the aircraft 
which may adversely affect the pilot’s vision).
• A ship which knows that an aircraft intends to ditch should prepare to 
give the pilot the following information:
 F wind direction and force,
 F direction, height, and length of primary and secondary swell 
systems,
 F current state of the sea,
 F current state of the weather.
• The pilot of an aircraft will choose his own ditching heading.

• If this is known by the ship, it should set course parallel to the ditching 
heading.
• Otherwise, the ship should set course parallel to the main swell system 
and into the wind component as shown in the figure below:
Primary

• SOLAS ships should have a SART to interact with 9 GHz vessel or 
aircraft radars for locating survival craft (SART responses show up as 
a distinctive line of about 20 equally-spaced blips on compatible radar 
displays, providing a bearing and range to the SART).
• AIS-SART is an alternative to survival craft radar transponders. AIS-SART 
is a transmitter which sends a signal to the AIS. It is programmed with

Maritime
• Ships transmitting a distress message on any of the above frequencies 
should use the appropriate procedures.
Aeronautical
• The aeronautical frequencies 3,023 kHz and 5,680 kHz may be used 
for communications by ships and participating CRSs/RCCs engaged in 
coordinated SAR operations. However, since these frequencies may not 
be continuously monitored, shore authorities may be needed to help

establish communications on these frequencies.
Land
• Land SAR can be conducted for many types of incidents, ranging 
from a downed aircraft to a hiker lost in the wilderness. Land facilities 
and aeronautical facilities may conduct coordinated land searches. 
Since each normally operates on different radio frequencies, advance 
coordination amongst local agencies may be necessary to establish 
effective communications.

effective communications.
 F Aircraft typically have at least one radio, so it may be easiest for the 
air facility and land facility to use an aeronautical frequency.
 F If the land facility does not have a portable aircraft radio, then 
communications may be provided by equipping an aircraft with a 
radio operating on ground frequencies.
Visual communications
• The following visual means of communication should be used when 
appropriate:
 F signalling lamp
 F international code flags

F signalling lamp
 F international code flags

Multiple aircraft communications
There should be agreed, common, on-scene procedures for the following:
• An agreed coordination frequency for radio voice communications

should be used within an area of SAR action. The frequency selected 
should be one which all aircraft can access, together with the ACO. 
Information that should be passed between an ACO and SAR aircraft is 
listed in appendices F-3, F-4 and F-5.
• Alternative frequencies should also be nominated by an ACO, if the 
agreed coordination frequency is likely to become too busy or unusable.

Section 8 – On-scene communications
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION) 8-17
• Care should be taken to ensure that aircraft and surface units involved 
in an operation are capable of complying with the communications 
procedures.
• Consideration should be given to enabling communications between 
an ACO and an OSC. However, it should not normally be necessary for 
SAR aircraft other than an ACO to communicate directly with the OSC.

• All SAR plans for multiple aircraft SAR operations should include 
procedures for use when radio communications fail. A failure of radio 
communications might affect aircraft, SRUs or persons in distress 
individually, or might involve a compromise of radio systems affecting 
several participants. The systems affected might include radio voice 
communications or radio systems designed to indicate the positions of 
aircraft, vessels or people, including transponders and other devices.

In general, the following principles should apply to most situations in 
which radio communications fail:
 F A backup means of radio voice communication should be 
determined and then nominated by an ACO, along with the normal 
communications plan.
 F The backup radio voice communications might include alternative 
frequencies, alternative radio communications systems or both. In 
the event of a radio communications failure, with no alternative

airborne communications available, aircraft should normally 
continue with their planned timings, events and flight path, still 
transmitting all position and altitude reports, until they are clear of 
the immediate on-scene area.
 F If an aircraft has not been given a plan when a radio communications 
failure occurs, then it should avoid the on-scene area, departing by 
an appropriate route and height.
 F Once clear of the on-scene area, aircraft should consider

moving near or landing at a suitable facility in order to establish 
communications by alternative methods.
If radio voice communications cannot be restored, then alternative procedures 
could be considered such as increasing the distances between aircraft using 
time. If not already included in SAR plans, then all participating airborne 
SRUs might have to be assembled together in order for this procedure to 
be briefed and understood. In most cases, this would result in considerable

delays to a SAR operation.
A diagram illustrating a basic example of communications during multiple 
aircraft SAR operations, involving an aircraft ACO is as follows:

Communications systems designed for long-range SAR can be different from 
the types of communications used at shorter ranges.
Long-range communications methods include the following:
• High frequency radio systems.
• Satellite communications systems.
• Position tracking systems, including those that enable two-way 
communications.
• The use of high flying aircraft to relay VHF radio communications to and

from lower flying SAR aircraft.
• Relay of information to and from SAR aircraft through ATS units.
• Relay of information by ships at sea able to communicate with SAR 
aircraft on marine band VHF frequencies, whilst a shore-based RCC 
uses satellite, MF or HF communications to communicate with the 
relaying ship(s).
• Relay of information by any surface units able to communicate with 
both SRUs and SMCs.

Requirements for coordination
• When a SAR incident occurs, an SMC will normally be designated, 
within an RCC.  The SMC will obtain SAR facilities, plan SAR operations, 
and provide overall coordination. The SMC may also designate an OSC 
to provide coordination at the scene to carry out plans to locate and 
rescue survivors. If no SMC has been designated or communications 
between the SMC and OSC are lost, the OSC may need to perform

some additional functions normally handled by an SMC. It may be 
necessary to designate a vessel OSC for surface activities and an aircraft 
coordinator (ACO) for aircraft activities if vessel–aircraft communications 
on scene are not practical.
Note: In practice, the terms RCC and SMC are often used interchangeably 
due to their close association.
• When a vessel or aircraft becomes aware of a SAR incident directly, it 
should alert the appropriate RCC as follows:

should alert the appropriate RCC as follows:
 F the RCC responsible for the SRR where the incident occurred
 F the nearest RCC
 F any RCC which can be reached; or
 F any communications facility (e.g. alerting post).
• The first facility to arrive in the vicinity of the SAR incident should 
assume OSC duties and, if necessary, SMC duties, until an SMC has 
been designated, and retain OSC duties until the SMC has designated 
an OSC.

an OSC.
• For the maritime environment, ship masters typically perform the OSC 
function due to ship endurance on scene unless more capable SRUs are 
available.
On-scene coordination
• The types of facilities involved and the region of the SAR incident may 
affect on-scene coordination.
• Available facilities may include:
 F designated SRUs

monitoring distress traffic.
• No advice received from these authorities can set aside the duties of any 
master as set forth in regulation V/33 of SOLAS 1974 (see appendix A).
Designation of on-scene coordinator (OSC)
• When two or more SAR facilities conduct operations together, the SMC 
may designate an OSC.
• If this is not practicable, facilities involved may designate, by mutual 
agreement, an OSC.
• This should, if necessary, be done as early as practicable and preferably

before arrival of facilities on scene.
• Until an OSC has been designated, the first facility arriving at the scene 
should assume the duties of an OSC.
• When deciding how much responsibility to delegate to the OSC, the 
SMC normally considers the endurance, communication and personnel 
capabilities of the facilities involved.
 F the poorer the communications on scene with the RCC, the more 
authority the OSC will need to initiate actions.
OSC duties and responsibilities

OSC duties and responsibilities
• The OSC should obtain a search and/or rescue action plan from the 
SMC via the RCC as soon as possible.
 F Normally, search planning is performed using trained personnel, 
advanced search planning techniques and information about the 
incident or distressed craft not normally available to the OSC. 
However, the OSC may still need to plan a search under some 
circumstances. Search operations should commence as soon as

facilities are available at the scene. If a search plan has not been 
provided by the SMC, the OSC should do the planning until an

Section 9 – On-scene coordinator
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION) 9-3
SMC assumes the search planning function. Simplified techniques 
are presented in section 12.
• Provide information to and coordinate operations of all SAR facilities 
on scene. An ACO may be designated to coordinate aircraft operations.
• Modify the plan as the situation on scene dictates, keeping the 
SMC advised (discuss proposed modifications with the SMC when 
practicable).
• Coordinate on-scene communications.

• Coordinate on-scene communications.
• Monitor the performance of other participating facilities and ensure 
operations are conducted safely.
• Make periodic situation reports (SITREPs) to the SMC. The standard 
SITREP format may be found in appendix D. SITREPs should include but 
not be limited to:
 F weather and sea conditions
 F the results of search and/or rescue action to date
 F any modifications made or suggested to the action plan
 F any future plans or recommendations.

F any future plans or recommendations.
• Maintain a detailed record of the operation:
 F on-scene arrival and departure times of SAR facilities, other vessels 
and aircraft engaged in the operation
 F areas searched
 F track spacing used
 F sightings and leads reported
 F actions taken
 F results obtained.
• Advise the SMC to release facilities no longer required.
• Report the number and names of survivors to the SMC.
• Provide the SMC with the names and designations of facilities with

survivors on board.
• Report which survivors are in each facility.
• Request additional SMC assistance when necessary (for example, 
medical evacuation of seriously injured survivors).
• In case of language difficulties, the International Code of Signals, the IMO 
Standard Marine Communication Phrases  (SMCP) and standard ICAO

phraseology contained in Annex 10 to the Convention on International 
Civil Aviation and PANS-ATM (ICAO Document 4444) should be used.
• On assuming the duty, the OSC should inform the appropriate RCC, via 
a CRS or ATS unit as necessary, and keep it informed of developments 
at regular intervals.
• Action card “OSC” provides a summary of key points. 
SAR operation risks

SAR operation risks
• Safe and effective SAR operations depend on coordinated teamwork 
and sound risk assessment.
• Saving distressed persons, and the safety of assisting personnel, should 
both be of concern to the OSC.
• The leaders (captain, pilot-in-command, or OSC) must ensure that 
personnel perform properly as a team with a common mission.
• Mishaps often follow a chain of errors that can start with mistakes made 
during SAR planning and lead to poor decisions during operations.

• Team safety is supported by:
 F proficiency in keeping everyone informed
 F matching resource capabilities to tasks
 F detecting and avoiding errors early
 F following standard procedures
 F adjusting to non-standard activities.
• Search and rescue action plans provided by the SMC are only guidance 
for the OSC and SAR facilities on scene.
 F the OSC may adjust the plans, based on the situation, and inform 
the SMC (discuss proposed modifications with the SMC when 
practicable)

practicable)
 F SAR facilities should keep the OSC advised of any difficulties or 
hazards encountered.
• The risks inherent in any SAR response must be considered against the 
chances for success and the safety of SAR personnel.
• Some practical concerns for assessing the situation include:
 F is the distressed craft in immediate danger of causing harm or 
placing the rescue facility in jeopardy?
 F can the rescue facility handle the weather conditions?

F has the distressed craft given enough information to prepare the 
assisting vessel to aid in the rescue?
 F can the assisting facility realistically be of assistance?
 F if recovery of a large number of survivors is a factor:
 – can the rescue facility accommodate them in regards to food, 
shelter, clothing, living space?
 – will the craft performing the rescue be stable with the survivors 
on board?
 F if helicopter operations are a factor:

F if helicopter operations are a factor:
 – is the vessel’s construction suitable for a vessel–aircraft joint 
operation?
 – does the rescue facility have enough crew members available 
to assist?
SAR briefing, debriefing and tasking
• The SMC, OSC and/or ACO should provide information to SAR facilities 
on relevant details of the distress and all instructions prior to the conduct 
of SAR operations. Parent agencies may provide this information by

briefing their facilities prior to deployment. Debriefings of the SAR 
facilities provide valuable information on effectiveness of the search 
and can influence planning of the next search. SAR facilities and the 
OSC should be aware of the type of information that the SMC is likely 
to request. Appendix E provides a sample SAR briefing and debriefing 
form.
• Masters and pilots-in-command of SAR facilities not designated as 
search and rescue units should also be contacted by the SMC, OSC

and/or ACO for debriefing.
Situation reports

• The OSC uses SITREPs to keep the SMC informed of on-scene mission 
progress and conditions, and addresses SITREPs to the SMC unless 
otherwise directed. SAR facilities use SITREPs to keep the OSC informed.
• The SMC uses SITREPs to keep superiors, other RCCs and any other 
interested agencies informed.
• Where pollution or threat of pollution exists from the vessel or aircraft

casualty, the agency tasked with environmental protection should be an 
information addressee on SITREPs from the SMC.
• Initial SITREPs should be transmitted as soon as details of an incident 
become clear enough to indicate SAR involvement.
 F SITREPs should not be delayed unnecessarily for confirmation of 
all details
 F Further SITREPs should be issued as soon as other relevant 
information is obtained
 F Information already passed does not need to be repeated

F During prolonged operations, “no change” SITREPs should be 
issued at intervals of about three hours to reassure recipients that 
nothing has been missed
 F When the incident is concluded, a “final” SITREP should be issued 
as confirmation.

General guidance
The information in this section provides guidance for the management and 
conduct of multiple aircraft SAR operations. Any of the described principles 
and procedures might have to be modified by SMCs, ACOs and SRUs, in 
order to deal with specific situations.
Number of SAR aircraft required  
and aircraft capabilities
The RCC/OSC/ACO responsible for the SAR operation should aim to achieve 
the most effective blend of aircraft and surface unit capabilities and efficient

use of aircraft on scene when needed.
• Minimize situations in which aircraft are airborne without a mission.
• Where more aircraft than needed are available for a SAR operation, 
some can be held in reserve. These aircraft can provide additional 
resources if needed, or relieve other aircraft involved in the operation 
for reasons related to aircrew fatigue or maintenance requirements.
The RCC/OSC/ACO should define the number of aircraft to be used in a

mission taking into account weather, distance from scene, nature of distress, 
available facilities and other operational issues. 
Given tasks should not rely on aircraft and aircrew conducting flying 
activities beyond their abilities, or their approved types of operations. In 
case such a task is given, the pilot-in-command shall inform the RCC/OSC/
ACO immediately.
Participation by supplementary aircraft 
with SAR capability

with SAR capability
In some situations, such as mass evacuations from offshore drilling platforms, 
large scale incidents over land areas etc., supplementary aircraft with SAR 
capability belonging to commercial companies or other organizations might 
be able to respond to incidents as part of existing emergency plans.

Section 10 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations
10-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
Refuelling facilities
The RCC/ACO/OSC is responsible for arranging refuelling facilities in a SAR 
operation. The pilot-in-command is responsible for ensuring that the facilities 
available are suitable, taking into account endurance and all operational 
needs. The pilot-in-command should take appropriate actions to ensure 
required refuelling and keep the RCC/ACO/OSC informed of changes to

on-scene and overall endurance.
Area of SAR action
An area of SAR action is an area of defined dimensions that is established, 
notified or agreed for the purposes of protecting aircraft during SAR 
operations and within which SAR operations take place.
Entering areas of SAR action
SAR aircraft intending to enter an area of SAR action should normally first 
contact the relevant unit (RCC, ACO, OSC or responsible ATS unit). They

should not enter the area until this unit gives them approval and provides 
them with sufficient information to safely join the flow of SAR aircraft 
involved in the operation (see also section 8). 
• Aircraft should contact the ACO when at least ten minutes’ flying time 
from the edge of an area of SAR action and pass entry information using 
the format described in appendix F-5.
• In the event that an area of SAR action has been established but an ACO

is not yet available, SAR aircraft should receive information that they 
require primarily from the coordinating RCC or OSC.
Entry report
• Airborne SRUs should make an entry report to the ACO when entering 
a search and rescue mission area, including:
 F call sign
 F nationality
 F type (specify fixed-wing or helicopter and type)
 F position
 F altitude (on pressure setting used)
 F ETA (at relevant point or search area)
 F endurance on scene, and

F endurance on scene, and
 F remarks (specific equipment or limitations).
Leaving areas of SAR action
Aircraft leaving areas of SAR action should contact the relevant unit before 
the area boundary and before changing to another frequency. Aircraft leaving 
should use the format described in appendix F-5.
Flights in areas of SAR action by other aircraft
Aircraft that are not involved in a SAR operation should normally not fly

within areas of SAR action. If such aircraft need to enter an area of SAR 
action, they should do so only with the approval of an SMC, ACO, OSC or 
coordinating ATS unit and are subject to the rules of the area or the relevant 
class of airspace. If an SMC or coordinating ATS unit is giving approval, the 
ACO or OSC should first be consulted.
Safety flow procedures
The main aim of on-scene procedures for SAR aircraft should be safety. In

general, there are two methods that can be used to ensure a safe flow of 
multiple aircraft:
• Horizontal spacing of aircraft operating visually should be the basic 
method used by SAR authorities and ACOs. It can be achieved by 
establishing coordinated specific routes to be flown by SAR aircraft to, 
from and within the area of SAR action.
• Vertical spacing of aircraft can be used in combination with horizontal 
spacing for aircraft operating visually but is a key consideration for safety

during poor weather conditions when more segregated operations are 
likely to be required.
In general, altitudes for RPAs should be kept apart from altitudes allocated 
for other SAR aircraft.
An effective method to ensure a safe flow of aircraft is by using a combination 
of both horizontal and vertical spacing. The best way to achieve this is 
through planning by the ACO, OSC or RCC and a clear understanding of 
procedures by all of the units and authorities involved.

The procedures used by SAR aircraft within an area of SAR action should be 
determined by the ACO in consultation with the SMC/OSC and pilots-in-
command of the SAR aircraft. The use of assigned flight paths, coordinated 
timings and designated entry and exit procedures will help to ensure a safe 
flow of SAR aircraft. These can be determined by using bearings and distances 
from features such as the casualty location, or described using coordinates

such as latitude and longitude. An effective way to organize multiple SAR

Section 10 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION) 10-3
Leaving areas of SAR action
Aircraft leaving areas of SAR action should contact the relevant unit before 
the area boundary and before changing to another frequency. Aircraft leaving 
should use the format described in appendix F-5.
Flights in areas of SAR action by other aircraft
Aircraft that are not involved in a SAR operation should normally not fly

within areas of SAR action. If such aircraft need to enter an area of SAR 
action, they should do so only with the approval of an SMC, ACO, OSC or 
coordinating ATS unit and are subject to the rules of the area or the relevant 
class of airspace. If an SMC or coordinating ATS unit is giving approval, the

Section 10 – Multiple aircraft SAR operations
10-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
aircraft engaged in an evacuation operation is to use procedures based on a 
central reference position (for example a vessel in distress).
Aircraft approach and departure flight paths
Approach and departure flight paths are usually influenced by the prevailing 
wind direction. Factors which might also have to be taken into account are:
• Fumes directly downwind from burning structures may be unsafe – the

direction of approach for aircraft might have to be off-set from the wind 
direction.
• Geographic features or the design of the casualty location might compel 
aircraft to approach only from certain directions. Structures such as 
cranes, towers or vertical obstructions in line with the wind direction, 
might be dangerous as physical obstacles or due to mechanical 
turbulence created downwind.
Instrument-based procedures

Instrument-based procedures
When weather conditions are so poor that flying operations cannot effectively 
be carried out according to visual procedures and the procedures described 
earlier in this section, then it might be possible for an aircraft to operate 
under instrument-based procedures in an effort to establish visual conditions 
in the area of SAR action.
Unless operations are carried out in controlled airspace under the control of

an ATS unit, aircraft pilots-in-command have full responsibility for avoiding 
other air traffic and surface obstructions in accordance with established 
regulations of their State for operations in instrument conditions and 
transitioning to visual conditions.
Approach fallback procedures
If on-scene conditions in an area of SAR action prevent a SAR aircraft 
from successfully completing an approach to the distress location, then an

approach fallback procedure should be flown in order to safely rejoin the 
flow or depart from the area. Approach fallback procedures must be briefed 
to all SAR aircraft by an ACO.

Transfer of ACO tasks
Before accepting the task the new ACO should understand the details of the 
SAR operation and the SMC’s plans. The details required may include the aim of 
the operation, the position of the missing object, number of persons in distress, 
other units involved, locations of participating aircraft, communications and 
any limitations to the operation. When possible, basic pre-flight information

should be provided by an SMC in order to simplify the transfer to the new ACO.
Checklists and guides
ACOs and SAR aircraft are recommended to use checklists or guides 
containing relevant information. Units who are likely to be designated as 
ACOs or take part as airborne SRUs in the event of a multiple aircraft SAR 
operation, should always have ACO checklists or guides available whenever 
they are on duty.
An operational summary known as the pilot information file (PIF) contains

useful in-flight information for all aircraft involved in multiple aircraft 
operations. The PIF, guides and checklists suitable for ACOs and SAR aircraft 
are contained in appendix F.

• Normally the SMC will determine the search area by use of search 
planning tools at the RCC and in cooperation with the OSC.
• Considerations in developing a search plan include:

Datum
• It will be necessary to establish a datum, or geographic reference, for the 
area to be searched. The following factors should be considered:
 F reported position and time of the SAR incident
 F any supplementary information such as DF bearings or sightings

F time interval between the incident and the arrival of SAR facilities
 F estimated surface movements of the distressed craft or survival 
craft, depending on drift. (The two figures following this discussion 
are used in calculating drift.) 
• The datum position for the search is found as follows:
 F drift has two components: leeway (LW) and total water current
 F leeway direction is downwind
 F leeway speed depends on wind speed

Visual search
• Individual search patterns have been designed so that an OSC can 
rapidly initiate a search by one or more craft.
• There will be a number of variables that cannot be foreseen. Search 
patterns based on visual search have been established which should 
meet many circumstances. They have been selected for simplicity and 
effectiveness and are discussed later in this section.

Sweep width, track spacing, and coverage
• Sweep width (W) is an index or measure of the ease or difficulty of 
detecting a given search object with a given sensor under a given set of 
environmental conditions. Tables of “uncorrected” sweep width values 
based on search object and meteorological visibility for calm weather, 
and correction factors based on search object and weather conditions 
(fw) are provided following this discussion. Multiplying the uncorrected

sweep width value ( WU) by the appropriate weather correction factor 
produces the corrected sweep width (WC):
WC = WU × fw
• Most search patterns consist of straight, parallel, equally spaced tracks 
covering a rectangular area. The distance between adjacent tracks is 
called the track spacing (S).
• Coverage (C) is the ratio of the corrected sweep width (WC) to the track 
spacing:
C = WC / S
• The recommended coverage (C) for most situations is 1.0, which means

the recommended track spacing (S) in most situations is the same as the 
corrected sweep width (WC):
Recommended S = WC
• Changes in weather, number of assisting craft, etc., may occur, making 
it prudent to alter the track spacing.
• All searching ships and aircraft should maintain safe distances from one 
another and accurately follow their assigned search patterns.
• In addition to the weather correction factors, other factors may be

considered, such as time of day, position of the sun, effectiveness of 
observers, etc.

Searching speed (V)
• To perform a parallel track search with several vessels moving together 
in a coordinated manner, all vessels should proceed at the same speed, 
as directed by the OSC.
• When performing a coordinated search with several vessels moving 
together, the search speed should normally be the maximum speed of

the slowest vessel present under the prevailing conditions.
• In restricted visibility, the OSC will normally order a reduction in 
searching speed.
Search area (A)
• Compute the search radius (R), using one of the following two methods:
 F if the search must commence immediately, assume R = 10 NM
 F if time is available for computation:
 – compute the area a craft can cover in a certain amount of 
time (T) by the formula:
A = S × V × T

time (T) by the formula:
A = S × V × T
 – the total amount of area (At) which can be covered by several 
craft is the sum of the areas each craft can cover:
At = A1 + A2 + A3 + ...
 – if all craft are searching at the same speed for the same amount 
of time, then:
At = N × A
where N is the number of search craft

Search patterns
• Factors to consider in deciding what type of search pattern to use 
include:
 F available number and types of assisting craft
 F size of area to be searched
 F type of distressed craft
 F size of distressed craft
 F meteorological visibility
 F cloud ceiling
 F type of sea conditions
 F time of day
 F arrival time at datum.
• It may be advisable for vessels, especially when searching for a person in

the water with either an expanding square search (SS) or a sector search 
(VS), to use dead reckoning (DR) navigation rather than more accurate 
navigational methods. DR navigation will minimize pattern distortion 
relative to the search object since it will automatically account for the 
currents affecting the search object’s drift during the search.
• For both vessels and aircraft, if a datum marker buoy or a smoke float or

other highly visible object is available, it should be deployed at datum 
and the pattern should be performed relative to it.
• Precise search pattern navigation using high-precision methods such as 
global satellite navigation systems will produce good patterns relative 
to the ocean bottom, but not relative to the drifting search object. This 
could allow the search object to drift out of the search area before the 
search facility arrives in that vicinity.
Expanding square search (SS)

Expanding square search (SS)
• Action card provided.
• Most effective when the location of the search object is known within 
relatively close limits.
• The commence search point is always the datum position.
• Often appropriate for vessels or small boats to use when searching for 
persons in the water or other search objects with little or no leeway.
• Due to the small area involved, this procedure must not be used 
simultaneously by multiple aircraft at similar altitudes or by multiple

vessels.
• Accurate navigation is required; the first leg is usually oriented directly 
into the wind to minimize navigational errors.
• It is difficult for fixed-wing aircraft to fly legs close to datum if S is less 
than 2 NM.
• A suitable marker (for example, a smoke float or a radio beacon) may be 
dropped at the datum position and used as a reference or navigational 
aid marking the centre of the pattern.

Coordinated vessel–aircraft search pattern
• Normally used only if there is an OSC present to give direction to and 
provide communications with the participating craft.
• Creeping line search, coordinated (CSC) is often used as an alternative 
name.
• The aircraft does most of the searching, while the ship steams along a 
course at a speed as directed by the OSC so that the aircraft can use it 
as a navigational checkpoint.

as a navigational checkpoint.
• The aircraft, as it passes over the ship, can easily make corrections to 
stay on the track of its search pattern.
• Gives a higher probability of detection (POD) than can normally be 
attained by an aircraft searching alone.
• Ship speed varies according to the speed of the aircraft and the size of 
the pattern. The relationship among the speed of the surface facility, the 
aircraft’s speed, the track spacing and the length of the search legs is

defined by the following equation:
Vs = (S × Va)/(L + S)
 where Vs is the speed of the surface facility in knots, S is the track spacing 
in nautical miles, Va is the aircraft’s true air speed in knots, and L is the 
length of the aircraft’s search leg in nautical miles.

• Search of large areas by ground facilities alone is usually not practical 
but may be effective for close examination of a small area.
Visual ground search
• Use obvious natural or artificial landmarks such as rivers or roads to 
delimit search sub-areas.
• Land search facilities should be equipped with large-scale topographical 
maps with search areas marked on them.

• Land search facility patterns are normally parallel tracks or contour 
searches using a line-abreast formation.
• Track spacing for lost persons is normally between five and eight metres.
• Search progress should be slow through wooded areas. One square 
kilometre of woods can be searched by 20 to 25 persons in about 
1.5 hours.

• boundary control of each successive pass through an area is assigned to 
the pivoting flanker
• track spacing between each searcher is determined by the distance a 
person can effectively search while keeping adjacent searchers in visual

and audible contact
• on first leg of search, one flanker will follow a natural boundary or 
predetermined compass course while the other flanker marks a trail at

• The aircraft may make a descending orbit away from the mountain 
before resuming the contour search at the lower altitude.
• The aircraft may spiral downwards around the mountain at a low but 
approximately constant rate of descent when there is not enough room

to make a circuit opposite to the direction of search.
• If the mountain cannot be circled, successive sweeps at the same altitude

Initiation of search at sea
• When a search facility arrives on scene in advance of the others, it should 
proceed directly to datum and commence an expanding square search.
• If possible, datum may be marked by putting over a liferaft or other

floating marker with a leeway similar to that of the search object, as a 
check on the drift.
• This can then be used as a datum marker throughout the search.
• As other facilities arrive, the OSC should select one of the search patterns, 
as appropriate, and allocate search sub-areas to individual facilities.
• In good visibility and with sufficient search facilities, the OSC may let 
the first facility continue its expanding square search while the others

conduct a parallel track search through the same area.
• In restricted visibility, or if sufficient search facilities are not available, it 
will probably be better to have the first facility break off the expanding 
square search and be available for initiation of a parallel track search.
Restricted visibility
• A parallel track search in restricted visibility poses problems because of 
the following considerations:
 F desirability of reducing the interval between SAR facilities as much

as possible consistent with safety
 F resulting loss of search area coverage
 F potential risk of collision.
• During restricted visibility, the OSC should direct a reduction of vessel 
speed as necessary.
• In such circumstances, any ship not fitted with radar, or whose radar 
has become defective, should consider dropping astern of other ships, 
informing the OSC of its action.
 F the ship’s search should continue when it judges its position (relative

to other searching ships) is safe to do so
 F if there is a reduction in visibility and ships have already started to 
carry out a search pattern, the OSC may decide that the safest action 
would be to continue the pattern in force despite the resulting loss 
of coverage.
• Should it be necessary for the OSC to consider initiating any of the 
patterns during conditions of restricted visibility, the following factors 
should be considered:

 F ships will be proceeding at a reduced speed and searches will take 
longer

Section 12 – Searching
12-22 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
 F to search the area thoroughly in such conditions must mean a 
reduction in track spacing
 F reduction in track spacing would require a reduction in the interval 
between SAR facilities and, thus, the carrying out of more tracks.
• The OSC may decide to accept a reduction in the area searched and 
should have regard to the direction and rate of estimated drift in deciding

whether to accept a reduction in one or both of the length and width of 
the search area.
• If visibility improves, the OSC should initiate such actions as will best 
make good the lost coverage which has taken place.
Look-outs
• Look-outs, also referred to as observers or scanners, are very important 
for effective searches. Their location on the search facility, scanning 
technique, and concentration on searching should be of concern to the

search facility. They should report any object or noise.
• Aircraft observers must concentrate visual scans within the distance of 
the track spacing.
Vessels:
Day
 F Place look-outs high on the vessel.
Night
 F Place look-outs on the bows as far forward and as low to the water’s 
edge as possible to hear any calls for help and to establish the best 
night vision.
• Appendix C provides advice for all look-outs. Factors affecting observer 
effectiveness include:

Multiple aircraft search missions
General
• The most likely situations in which multiple aircraft might be involved 
in searches is when large areas need to be searched in which the 
confidence of the datum position is low
• The procedures described below generally assume that visual search 
techniques are used. However, other technical devices and/or 
techniques might also be required or SAR aircraft might only be able to

locate persons in distress by homing onto transmissions from emergency 
distress beacons, transponders or other devices. In these situations, 
techniques might have to be modified and the need for multiple SAR 
aircraft might have to be considered carefully.
Safety and search effectiveness
• Procedures that ensure flight safety, without making the search ineffective 
should be used. Aircraft should be given sufficient operational freedom

to carry out their searches effectively, but should conform to safety 
procedures briefed by the RCC, ACO, OSC or ATS. A high degree of 
situational awareness amongst the aircraft should always be encouraged.

Section 12 – Searching

• Methods used to safely keep aircraft apart will depend on the on-scene 
conditions. Beginning with good weather conditions and progressing 
to poor conditions, methods for keeping aircraft apart to enhance flight 
safety are as follows:
 F visual methods
 F flow methods
 F coordination zones
 F no fly zones.
Visual methods
• Visual methods involve the allocation of aircraft to search areas and

aircraft avoiding each other visually. Visual methods may be the only 
measure necessary when weather conditions on scene are good.
• When using visual methods, the RCC, ACO or OSC can allow aircraft 
more freedom of action compared to other, more restrictive, methods. 
However, this freedom will not relieve the need to operate with due 
regard to other flight information and reporting requirements.
Flow methods
• Flow methods can be used to assist keeping SAR aircraft apart in slightly

poorer conditions, by ensuring that they fly the same search patterns 
(commence search point/direction of creep, etc.) relative to adjacent 
search areas.
• The first aircraft on scene should be allocated the search area furthest 
away from the direction of creep. This method generally enables 
aircraft to execute effective searches of areas with a minimum of radio 
communication. All aircraft should still be very well informed of each

other to avoid any conflicts, particularly for small track spacings and 
with high performance aircraft turning circles at high speeds before 
rejoining search legs.
CSP CSP CSP CSP
Direction of creep
• Specific search altitudes may be assigned for SRUs, to allow an extra 
margin of safety when aircraft operate in close proximity to each other. 
• However, in this situation the effectiveness of the search may be 
compromised.

compromised.
• An additional consideration is that aircraft may need to deviate from 
their assigned altitudes if they need to investigate objects on the surface 
or drop SAR supplies.
• All aircraft should use the same reference for altitude �
CSP 500ft CSP 200ft CSP 500ft CSP 200ft

Coordination zones
• Coordination zones are border areas established between adjacent 
search areas, which SAR aircraft can only enter under specific conditions.

Coordination zones enable aircraft to have operational flexibility within 
their allocated search areas and ensure a level of safety between them.
• The dimensions of a coordination zone depend on the on-scene 
conditions and the size of a search area. As a general guide a coordination 
zone might be 2 nautical miles across, but this size may be increased or 
decreased if needed.
• Allowance for aircraft turns at the end of search legs needs to be

considered, especially for high speed aircraft.
• Before entering a coordination zone, aircraft sharing the zone 
communicate with each other to safely coordinate the entry. The aircraft 
should call again when leaving the zone.
• The ACO, OSC or RCC should ensure that the aircraft have a clear 
understanding of their mutual operating areas.
2 NM 2 NM 2 NM
No fly zones
• If on-scene conditions are sufficiently difficult, no fly zones can be

used in which flight is not permitted while searching is taking place 
in adjacent areas. The dimensions of no fly zones can be similar to 
coordination zones.
• Whenever no fly zones are used, the ACO should coordinate with the 
SMC and OSC to ensure that the no fly zones are searched appropriately 
during the SAR operation.

Further action on completion of initial phase
• The initial phase is normally considered to have been completed when, 
in the absence of further information, searching ships have completed 
one search of the most probable area.
• If at that stage nothing has been located, it will be necessary for the 
SMC, in consultation with the OSC, to consider the most effective

method of continuing the search.
• Failure to locate the search object may be due to one or more of the 
following causes:
 F errors in position owing to navigational inaccuracies or inaccuracy 
in the distress communications reporting the position. This is 
especially likely to apply if the position of datum was based on an 
estimated position using incomplete information
 F an error in drift estimation
 F failure to sight the search object during the search although it was

in the search area. This is most likely to occur if the search object is 
a small craft, a survival craft, survivors in the water, a light aircraft 
forced down in rough or densely vegetated terrain, or survivors in 
rough or densely vegetated terrain. In the case of aircraft forced 
down in a forested area, the best indicator may be broken treetops
 F the craft having sunk without a trace. Other than the case of a small 
ship or craft in rough weather, experience has shown that there are

usually some traces, even if only debris or oil patches.
Navigational inaccuracies of searching ships
• This is most likely to apply when navigational fixes cannot be obtained. 
In this situation, the OSC may:
 F re-search the same area, allowing for added drift during the time 
elapsed since calculating last datum;
 F expand the most probable area, after allowing for added drift, and 
search the expanded area; or
 F expand the area more in one direction than another, depending on

circumstance and information available.
• Determine a new probable area based upon any additional information 
received.
• Where information is received to indicate that the original datum was 
grossly inaccurate, determining an entirely new probable area would be 
advisable.
• A small search object, which is easily missed in the daytime, may 
become visible at night if it shows lights, flares, or other pyrotechnics.
• The SMC and OSC should, therefore, consider using surface craft at

night to search again areas covered by day.
• It is good practice when searching for survivors in small craft, in survival 
craft, or in the water, to stop the engines occasionally at night and in 
restricted visibility by day to listen for cries for help.
Evidence of distressed craft found
• In some cases, the search may provide evidence of the distressed craft 
without survivors being found.
• This evidence may provide information for a recalculation of datum and 
revision of the search area.

revision of the search area.
• A low-lying, half-sunken loaded ship or aircraft may drift more slowly 
than a floating survival craft, even if a drogue is used.
• A derelict may drift at a considerable angle off the prevailing wind 
direction.
• When wreckage is located it usually consists of debris, possibly with an 
oil slick.
• Should this have come from the distressed craft, survival craft will 
usually be found downwind from the debris.

• Manoeuvring and warning signals will be of particular importance in the 
circumstances.
• The master of any ship taking part in a search should endeavour to carry 
out all directions received and have due regard for the safety of the ship 
and crew.
• To initiate and conduct coordinated search patterns, the OSC should 
transmit a limited number of manoeuvring instructions by the most

appropriate means, and in plain language when practicable.
• The text of the message for the initiation of a pattern and subsequent 
messages relating to its conduct or adjustment should be in standard 
form. The International Code of Signals may serve this purpose and a list 
of standard text from it follows:

in a pattern to carry out a major alteration of course (anything over 90°) 
before proceeding to a new area, it would be desirable for the OSC to 
direct this in two steps.
Search unsuccessful
• The OSC should continue the search until all reasonable hope of 
rescuing survivors has passed.
• The OSC may need to decide whether to terminate an unsuccessful

search. This should be discussed with an RCC whenever practicable. For 
this determination, factors to consider include the following:
 F probability that survivors, if alive, were in the search area
 F probability of detection of the search object, if it were in the areas 
searched
 F time remaining that search facilities can remain on scene
 F probability that survivors might still be alive.
• The following diagram shows realistic survival times for people believed

to be in water at various temperatures. If there is a possibility that 
survivors may have survival equipment or have been able to get out of 
the water, search times should be extended.

• The direction of approach to the distressed craft (or survivors) will 
depend upon the circumstances.
 F some emergencies, such as a ship on fire, may have to be approached 
from windward and others, such as liferafts, from leeward.
 F the two key factors are:
 – whether a lee-side protection is necessary during the rescue 
operation, and
 – the comparative rates of drift of the distressed craft and the

rescuing ship.
• If time permits, assess the relative rates of drift.
 F this precaution may prevent serious mishaps during the rescue 
operations
 F in general, survivors in the water are best approached from the 
leeward side.
Medical support
• If practicable, arrange for injured personnel requiring the attention of a 
medical officer to be transferred to a ship carrying one.
• See also section 3.
Ocean incident
 F If there is no ship available with a medical officer on board, the

rescue facility should request the OSC, if assigned, or the SMC to 
consider transmitting an urgency message requesting such a ship to 
a rendezvous.
 F If necessary, a CRS may be contacted for ship reporting systems 
information on the availability of ships with a medical officer.
Coastal incident
 F The SMC should arrange for medical assistance to be sent from shore.
 F The local CRS may act as an intermediary.
Recovery of survivors by assisting vessels

Recovery of survivors by assisting vessels
• Vessels to which Chapter III of the SOLAS Convention applies shall 
have, and other vessels are recommended to have, ship-specific plans 
and procedures for recovery of people from the water. The action card

Section 14 – Rescue or assistance by vessels
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION) 14-3
“Master’s Checklist – Recovery of people in the water” and the IMO 
publication Pocket Guide to Recovery Techniques provide additional 
guidance.
• Seafarers should consider how to recover survivors into their own vessels 
under various environmental conditions. Recovery methods include:
 F using throwing rockets or heaving lines to pass lifebuoys and/or 
lines to survivors

lines to survivors
 F streaming a rope, with lifebuoys or other flotation attached
 F utilizing specialized recovery equipment
 F rigging pilot ladders, Jacob’s ladders or nets, preferably clear of the 
ship’s side, with safety lines. If survivors are unable to climb, ladders 
or nets may have to be recovered with the survivors secured to 
them. Where practicable:
 – rig ladders or nets from pilot doors or other low openings
 – deploy safety lines with rescue strops or loops

– use suitably equipped crew members to assist survivors directly
 – deploy a liferaft with the ladder or net to act as a transfer 
platform
 F pulling survivors up suitable marine evacuation systems
 F deploying liferafts or lifeboats for survivors to hold onto, or climb 
into
 F using rafts or boats as lifts, leaving them on the falls if conditions 
permit
 F lifting survivors using gantries, cranes, davits or derricks, with lines 
rigged to minimize swinging against the ship’s side

F deploying purpose-built or improvised recovery baskets
 F rigging a boat rope for boats and survival craft to secure alongside
 F lowering embarkation ladders.
• Any lights in use must not be directed towards helicopters operating in 
the area.
• Survivors in the water should be lifted in a horizontal or near-horizontal 
position if possible (for example, in two strops or loops; one under the 
arms, the other under the knees) to minimize the risk of shock induced

by sudden transfer from the water and possible hypothermia. However, 
especially for short lifts, do not delay if the survivor’s airway (mouth/
nose) is threatened by, for example, backwash from the rescuing vessel, 
but lift by the quickest method. If a rescue craft has been deployed to

Section 14 – Rescue or assistance by vessels
14-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
recover the survivor, he should, if possible, remain in the craft during its 
recovery on board the ship.
• Assisting vessels should also be prepared to receive survivors from 
helicopters: see section 16.
• When the risks involved in recovery operations outweigh the risks of 
leaving the survivors in life-saving appliances, consider the following 
actions:

actions:
 F using the ship to provide a lee for the survivors
 F deploying life-saving appliances from the assisting vessel
 F maintaining visual and communications contact with the survivors

provided with a rescue sling, basket, net, stretcher or seat.
Rescue sling
• The most widely used means for evacuating persons is the rescue sling, 
if possible, together with a helicopter crew member.

• Slings are suited for quickly picking up uninjured persons, but are 
unsuitable for persons with injuries.
• The sling is put on in much the same way as one puts on a coat, ensuring 
that the loop of the sling passes behind the back and under both armpits.
• The person using the sling must face the hook. Hands should be clasped 
in front as shown.

in front as shown.
• The person must not sit in the sling, nor should the sling be unhooked.
• Experience has shown that when winching a person suffering from 
hypothermia, especially after immersion in water, a rescue basket or 
stretcher or a second sling (under the knees) should be used to keep the 
person in a horizontal or near horizontal position, since winching in a 
vertical position may cause severe shock or cardiac arrest.

Rescue sling
Double lift method
• Most SAR helicopters use the double lift method which consists of a 
normal sling and a seating belt manned by a helicopter crew member.
• This method is suitable for pick-up of incapacitated persons from land, 
water, or the deck of a vessel, if they are not injured badly enough so 
that a stretcher has to be used.
• The helicopter crew member puts the person into the sling and conducts 
the winching operation.

Long-range operations
Long range is any distance that significantly limits or compromises the ability

of SAR aircraft to operate on scene effectively and safely.
Long-range procedures
• At long ranges, SAR aircraft might need to minimize the fuel used while 
flying in transit, in order to permit more time operating on scene.
• It might be necessary for SAR aircraft to fly as directly as possible to and 
from an incident, with the result that multiple aircraft SAR procedures 
have to be modified and rely on basic safety arrangements.

• These arrangements could include separate arrival times on scene and 
basic inbound and outbound height differences in order to keep aircraft 
safely apart.
• Additional considerations for long-range SAR communications are 
described in section 8.
Bringing a casualty vessel within range
• If the casualty is a vessel underway, SMCs should consider the possibility 
of requesting it to move to a point within the effective range of SAR 
aircraft or other forms of assistance.

aircraft or other forms of assistance. 
• Alternatively, it might be possible for SAR aircraft to refuel at locations 
that effectively bring a casualty within their maximum radius for SAR 
operations. It is also effective for SMCs to use both of these options at 
the same time.

Helicopter operations
• Helicopter operations include landing and winching on land or at sea. 
Landings on vessels will normally be done on well-equipped and trained 
craft. Discussion here will focus on winching since it may be conducted 
for various trained and untrained facilities. Winching can be hazardous 
to the persons being hoisted, the rescue facility and others at the scene 
of the winching.
• Follow the instructions of the rescue facility and inform when unable to

do so. In principle, only act after instructions of the rescue facility have 
been received.
• The final decision about whether it is safe to conduct the winching, 
subject to agreement of personnel at the scene, is with the person 
in command of the rescue facility. The distressed vessel’s captain is 
responsible for the safety of his vessel and personnel and may decide 
against the winching.
• The vessel or the ground facility at the rescue scene should be briefed

on what is required. A sample briefing is provided after this discussion. 
This briefing can be given by another SAR facility prior to the on-scene 
arrival of the helicopter.
Communications between ship and helicopter 
for winching operations
• It is important that information be exchanged between the vessel and 
helicopter, and that it is understood.
• A direct radio link should be established between ship and helicopter. 
This is usually accomplished by having the helicopter equipped with a

marine VHF FM radio able to transmit and receive on at least channel 16 
and preferably on two other simplex working frequencies.
• The following information should be exchanged between the helicopter 
and the vessel: 
 F position of the vessel
 F course and speed to the rendezvous position
 F local weather conditions

indicated in the International Code of Signals – General Section, 
DISTRESS – EMERGENCY under AIRCRAFT – HELICOPTER.
Sample briefing to vessel prior to helicopter winching
(Modify text for helicopter winching over land)
“A helicopter is proceeding to your position and should arrive at

approximately _. Maintain a radio watch on _ MHz/kHz/channel 
_ VHF-FM. The helicopter will attempt to contact you. Provide a clear 
area for winching, preferably on the port stern. Lower all masts and booms 
that can be lowered. Secure all loose gear. Keep all unnecessary people 
clear of the pick-up area. Just before the helicopter arrives, secure the ship’s 
radar or put it in standby mode. Do not direct lights towards the helicopter as

it will adversely affect the pilot’s vision. Direct available lighting to illuminate 
the pick-up area. When the helicopter arrives, change course to place the 
wind 30° on the port bow and maintain a steady course and steerageway. 
As the helicopter approaches, strong winds may be produced by the rotors, 
making it difficult to steer. The helicopter will provide all the equipment for 
the winching and instruct you about the winching procedures. A line will

probably be trailed from the helicopter for your crew to guide the rescue 
device as it is lowered. Before touching the rescue device, allow it to touch 
your vessel. This will discharge static electricity. If you have to move the 
rescue device from the pick-up area to load the patient, unhook the cable 
from the rescue device and lay the loose hook on the deck so it can be 
retrieved by the helicopter. If a helicopter crewman is lowered down, follow

his instructions. If this is not the case, act as follows:
 F Do not attach the loose hook or the trail line to your vessel.
 F If you have to move the rescue device from the pick-up area to load 
the patient, unhook the cable and trail line from the rescue device 
and lay the loose hook on the deck so it can be retrieved by the 
helicopter.
 F The helicopter may move to the side while the patient is being 
loaded.
 F Have the patient wear a lifejacket and attach any important records,

along with a record of medications that have been administered.
 F When the patient is securely loaded, signal the helicopter to move 
into position and lower the hook.
 F After allowing the hook to ground on the vessel, re-attach the hook 
and the trail line to the rescue device.
 F Signal the winch operator with a “thumbs up” when you are ready 
for the winching to begin. 
 F As the rescue device is being retrieved, tend the trail line to prevent 
the device from swinging.

the device from swinging. 
 F When you reach the end of the trail line, gently toss it over the 
side.”
Guidance for vessels
Positioning of landing or pick-up areas
• Operating areas on vessels should be located on the main deck and, if 
practicable, arranged on both port and starboard sides.
 F the operating areas consist of an outer manoeuvring zone and an 
inner clear zone
 F whenever possible, the clear zone should be close to the ship’s side

F any amount of the manoeuvring zone may extend outboard but 
none of the clear zone may do so.
• Identify clear access to the operating area and exit from it to the ship’s 
side.
• Establish the best position within the area for the manoeuvring zone that 
will give the largest clear zone.
• Areas close to the bow are not recommended due to the increased 
air-flow turbulence created by the ship’s passage.
• As large a stretch of deck as possible which is clear of obstructions

should be made available as a pick-up area.
• Larger vessels may have areas marked on their decks. These markings 
are an aiming circle with “H” painted in white for landing, or a circle 
with an inner circle painted yellow for winching only, as shown below.

• During the night, pick-up area floodlighting should be provided and the

floodlights should be located so as to avoid glare to pilots in flight or to 
personnel working on the area.
 F the arrangement and aiming of floodlights should be such that they 
are not directed towards the helicopter and shadows are kept to a 
minimum
 F the spectrum distribution of the floodlights should be such that the 
surface and obstacle markings can be correctly identified
 F obstacles should be clearly identified by obstacle lights

F where pick-up area floodlighting and obstacle lighting cannot 
be provided, the ship should, in consultation with the pilot, be 
illuminated as brightly as possible, particularly the pick-up area 
and any obstructions, such as masts, funnels, deck gear, radar 
antenna, etc.
• Loose objects should be cleared away or secured due to downwash 
from the helicopter.
• The helicopter may be able to lift a person from a lifeboat or a liferaft

secured on a long painter. However, liferafts have been overturned by 
the helicopter’s downwash.
Hi-Line technique
• In certain circumstances, typically, poor weather, obstructed vision or 
confined winching area, it may not be possible to lower the helicopter 
crewman or lifting harness to the deck from directly above the vessel. In 
such cases the Hi-Line technique may be used.
• A weighted line, attached to the aircraft’s hook by a weak link, is lowered

to the vessel. It may be illuminated by cyaline lightsticks. The transfer 
area should give unobstructed access to the deck edge.
• The line should be handled by one member of the vessel’s crew.
• ONLY WHEN INSTRUCTED BY THE HELICOPTER CREW the slack 
should be hauled in (it is advisable to wear gloves).
• THE LINE MUST NOT BE ATTACHED TO THE VESSEL.
• The helicopter will pay out the line and descend to one side of the vessel

while the crewman continues to take in the slack. A second crewmember 
should coil the spare line into a container, clear of obstructions.
• When the helicopter crewman or lifting harness reaches deck height the 
line must be hauled in to bring the winch hook on board (considerable 
effort may be required).
• The static discharge line must touch the vessel before contact with the 
hook is made.
• At any time the helicopter may discontinue the operation, in which case

the line must be paid out immediately, clear of obstructions.
• When prepared for winching the helicopter crewman, if present, or a 
member of the vessel’s crew, should indicate to the helicopter by hand 
signals.
• The helicopter will climb and winch in the cable. The line must be paid 
out maintaining sufficient force to prevent a swing.
• If multiple transfers are required to be made the line should be retained. 
On the final lift the end of the line should be released over the side of

the vessel.
Vessel preparation
SRUs
• Vessels taking part in a SAR mission in the vicinity of aircraft operations, 
should consider the following:
 F keep clear of aircraft approach path
 F keep clear of missed approach flight path

 F in search missions including both airborne and surface units, keep 
the ACO/OSC/SMC aware of own position as advised.
Distress vessel
• In multiple aircraft SAR operations or mass evacuation situations, the 
master of the vessel in distress should agree with the ACO/OSC/SMC on 
cooperation with airborne units:
 F determine landing/hoist positions
 F determine working channels
 F inform when ready to receive helicopters

F inform when ready to receive helicopters
 F be prepared to provide ship manifest to RCC or SRU
 F be prepared to guide rescue personnel arriving on ship
 F be prepared to gather passengers to landing/hoist positions and to 
guide them
 F determine number of casualties and their medical triage status
 F plan order of evacuation and relay to RCC/OSC/ACO
 F update vessel position, speed and course at regular intervals; 1 NM 
can be considered a significant difference in position for aircraft

especially in poor weather conditions.
Other considerations
• Vessels which are not well suited for helicopter landing operations (due 
to their size, design or nature of their cargoes) should carefully consider 
how best to remove or deliver people or equipment in an emergency.
Safety preparations
• A briefing to discuss the safety aspects and operational details of 
helicopter–ship operations should be held for all involved personnel 
prior to the operation’s commencement.

Section 16 – Vessel/helicopter operations
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION) 16-9
• Wherever available, the following fire-fighting equipment or its 
equivalent should be ready during helicopter operations:
 F at least two dry powder extinguishers with an aggregate capacity of 
not less than 45 kg
 F a suitable foam application system (fixed or portable), capable of 
delivering a foam solution at a rate of not less than 6 litres per minute

for each square metre of clear zone and sufficient foam compound to 
enable the rate to be maintained for at least five minutes
 F carbon dioxide (CO2) extinguishers with an aggregate capacity of 
not less than 18 kg
 F a deck water system capable of delivering at least two jets of water 
to any part of the helicopter operating area
 F at least two fire hose nozzles which should be of the dual-purpose 
type
 F fire-resistant blankets and gloves
 F sufficient fire proximity suits

F sufficient fire proximity suits
 F portable fire-fighting equipment for oil fires should be stationed 
near the disembarkation space
 F if possible, the fire-fighting pump should be started and hoses 
should be connected and kept in readiness.
• For better identification from the air, and also for showing the direction 
of the wind to the helicopter pilot, flags and pennants should be flown.
• All crew members concerned, as well as the persons to be evacuated, 
should wear lifejackets

should wear lifejackets
 F this precaution may be amended when it would cause unjustifiable 
deterioration of the condition of the patient to be transferred.
• Care should be taken that the deck party and persons to be evacuated 
do not wear loose clothing or headgear.
• On no account should the lifting device or the trail line on the end of 
the winch cable be secured to any part of the ship or allowed to become 
entangled in the rigging or fixtures.
• Never fix a trail line to a person.

• Never fix a trail line to a person.
• Ship’s personnel should not attempt to grasp the lifting device unless 
requested to do so by the helicopter crew.
 F Even in this case, a metal part of the lifting device should first be 
allowed to touch the deck in order to avoid possible shock due to 
static electricity.

Section 16 – Vessel/helicopter operations
16-10 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
• When helicopter winching is to be done from carriers of flammable 
or explosive cargo, or in the vicinity of a flammable mixture spillage, 
the winching must be grounded clear of spillage or the carrier’s tank 
venting area in order to preclude a possible fire or explosion from an 
electrostatic discharge.
• The helicopter pilot will want to approach the ship in such a way that

the helicopter will hover into the relative wind and with the pilot’s side 
(starboard) closest to the ship during the approach.
• If the helicopter is to approach in the usual manner, from the stern, the 
ship should maintain a constant speed through the water and keep the 
wind 30° on the port bow or on either beam if the area is amidships, or 
30° on the starboard quarter if the area is forward.
• A flow of air, as free of turbulence as possible, clear of smoke and other

visibility restrictions, over the pick-up area is very important.
• These procedures may be modified on instructions from the pilot if 
communications exist.
• Personal belongings should not be taken along.
 F Loose gear can become entangled in the winch cable or pulled up 
into the helicopter rotors.

The offset or beam-on intercept:
 F The offset or beam-on intercept is used when the SAR facility is to 
one side of the track being made good by the distressed craft.
 F The SAR facility intercepts the track of the distressed craft.
 F When the distressed craft has the greater ground speed (GS), the

SAR facility will have to be closest to the point of intended landing 
to make the offset interception possible. There are three methods 
for performing offset or beam-on intercepts.
Method 1:
 F plot the relative positions of both the distressed craft (A) and the 
intercepting SAR facility (B) for that time at which the intercepting 
SAR facility is ready to proceed
 F join these two positions with a line (AB)
 F lay off the distressed craft’s track in the direction of its heading and

project it a reasonable distance on the chart (AC)

 F with the centre of the circle being the point of departure of the 
intercepting SAR facility, and using a radius equal to the distance it 
will cover in the time interval used for the distressed craft, describe 
an arc and mark the spot (W) where the arc cuts the transferred line
 Note: If the speed of the intercepted or intercepting craft is such that the

scale of the chart makes it unreasonable to use a full hour, then it will be 
necessary to use a proportional interval of time to ensure that the radius 
of the arc cuts the transferred line.
 F draw a line from the position of the intercepting SAR facility through 
the spot where the arc cuts the transferred line – this is the intercept 
heading/course for the intercepting SAR facility. By projecting this 
line until it cuts the projected track or course line of the distressed

craft, one finds the position where the intercept will take place (D).
 F to find the time it will take for the intercept, measure the distance 
from the initial position of the intercepting craft to the point 
of intercept and divide this distance (BD) by the speed of the 
intercepting craft.

receive transmission from the distressed craft, and is executed as shown 
in the following figure, using magnetic bearings.
 F determine the bearing to the distressed craft, turn the SAR facility to 
a heading 45° from this bearing in the direction the distressed craft

Aircraft intercepts
When visual contact has been made, the intercepting aircraft will normally 
take up a position slightly above, behind and to the left of the distressed craft. 
Minimum time-to-scene intercept (MTTSI)
• This procedure was developed to intercept and escort higher-speed 
aircraft with lower-speed aircraft SRUs.
 F because of speed differential, it may be necessary for the SRU

aircraft to turn short of the interception point on the distressed 
aircraft track to minimize the time-to-scene (provide maximum 
rescue availability) over the remaining distance to be flown
 F compute the SRU’s maximum operating distance
 F compute the time to launch the SRU
 F compute the time at which the SRU should turn around (time-to-
turn or TTT) and allow the distressed aircraft to begin overtaking it
 F when the SRU reaches the turn-around point, its time-to-scene

from there to the distressed aircraft’s position should equal the 
SRU’s remaining time to the destination at the time the distressed 
aircraft lands
 F keep the distressed aircraft informed of the type and the status of 
the interception being performed.
• The MTTSI should be used when all of the following conditions exist:
 F the distressed aircraft is not, nor expected to be, in immediate 
danger of ditching, crash landing, or bailout before it reaches the 
SRU’s maximum operating distance

SRU’s maximum operating distance
 F the SRU will depart and return to the same aerodrome that is the 
distressed aircraft’s destination
 F the SRU’s true air speed is less than that of the distressed aircraft
 F the position of the distressed aircraft is accurately known and it 
is proceeding from that location directly to the aerodrome from 
which the SRU will be launched.

IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION) 19-9
• The SRU’s maximum operating distance is computed as follows:
 F subtract the required fuel reserve time and the estimated time 
required on scene from the SRU’s maximum endurance to get the 
maximum operational endurance
 F the SRU’s maximum operating distance is found by using the 
formula:

statements carefully.
Note: Questions should be asked in a calm voice and the questioner should

avoid suggesting answers to the survivor. Explain that the information 
required is for the success of the SAR operation and may be of great value 
for future SAR operations.

Deceased persons
Handling of deceased persons ........................  21-1

Handling of deceased persons
• Searching for and recovering bodies is not normally considered to be 
part of SAR operations. However, handling of human remains may at 
times be necessary.
• Human remains at an aircraft crash site should not be disturbed or 
removed without authorization except for compelling reasons.
• Without exposing rescuers to danger, an attempt should be made to 
identify deceased persons. All articles removed from or found near each

body must be kept separate, preferably in a container so labelled that 
it can be correlated later with the body. All these articles should be 
handed over to the proper authority as soon as possible.
• When human remains are recovered during a SAR operation, or when a 
death occurs on board a SAR facility, a waybill should be made out for 
each deceased person. It should contain the full name and age of the 
deceased (if known), as well as the place, date, time, and cause of death

(if possible). This waybill should be made out in the national language of 
the SAR facility and, wherever possible, in English.
• Considerations for the transport of human remains include:
 F on vessels, body bags or sailcloth for human remains should be 
carried. (If human remains are kept on board for any length of time, 
they should be properly wrapped and put in a suitable place on the 
vessel.)
 F SAR aircraft do not normally transport human remains. (However,

SAR aircraft may have to carry human remains if no other means 
are readily available.)
 F immediately after return to a base specified by the RCC, the remains 
must be handed over to the appropriate authorities, accompanied 
by the waybill
 F if it is known or suspected that a deceased person had an infectious 
disease, all material and objects which have been in direct contact 
with the deceased person must be cleaned and disinfected or 
destroyed.

Appendix A
Regulation V/33 of the International Convention  
for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974
Distress situations: obligations and procedures
1 The master of a ship at sea which is in a position to be able to 
provide assistance, on receiving information from any source that persons 
are in distress at sea, is bound to proceed with all speed to their assistance, 
if possible informing them or the search and rescue service that the ship

is doing so. This obligation to provide assistance applies regardless of the 
nationality or status of such persons or the circumstances in which they 
are found. If the ship receiving the distress alert is unable or, in the special 
circumstances of the case, considers it unreasonable or unnecessary to 
proceed to their assistance, the master must enter in the log-book the reason 
for failing to proceed to the assistance of the persons in distress, taking into

account the recommendation of the Organization to inform the appropriate 
search and rescue service accordingly.
1�1 Contracting Governments shall coordinate and cooperate to ensure 
that masters of ships providing assistance by embarking persons in distress at 
sea are released from their obligations with minimum further deviation from 
the ships’ intended voyage, provided that releasing the master of the ship 
from the obligations under the current regulation does not further endanger

the safety of life at sea. The Contracting Government responsible for the 
search and rescue region in which such assistance is rendered shall exercise 
primary responsibility for ensuring such coordination and cooperation 
occurs, so that survivors assisted are disembarked from the assisting ship and 
delivered to a place of safety, taking into account the particular circumstances 
of the case and guidelines developed by the Organization. In these cases the

relevant Contracting Governments shall arrange for such disembarkation to 
be effected as soon as reasonably practicable.

Appendix A
A-2 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
2 The master of a ship in distress or the search and rescue service 
concerned, after consultation, so far as may be possible, with the masters 
of ships which answer the distress alert, has the right to requisition one or 
more of those ships as the master of the ship in distress or the search and 
rescue service considers best able to render assistance, and it shall be the

duty of the master or masters of the ship or ships requisitioned to comply 
with the requisition by continuing to proceed with all speed to the assistance 
of persons in distress.
3 Masters of ships shall be released from the obligation imposed by 
paragraph 1 on learning that their ships have not been requisitioned and that 
one or more other ships have been requisitioned and are complying with the 
requisition. This decision shall, if possible, be communicated to the other

requisitioned ships and to the search and rescue service.
4 The master of a ship shall be released from the obligation imposed 
by paragraph 1 and, if his ship has been requisitioned, from the obligation 
imposed by paragraph 2 on being informed by the persons in distress or by 
the search and rescue service or by the master of another ship which has 
reached such persons that assistance is no longer necessary.
5 The provisions of this regulation do not prejudice the Convention

for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Assistance and Salvage 
at Sea, signed at Brussels on 23 September 1910, particularly the obligation 
to render assistance imposed by article 11 of that Convention.
6 Masters of ships who have embarked persons in distress at sea shall 
treat them with humanity, within the capabilities and limitations of the ship.

Limitations of the eye
• The human eye is complex. Its function is to receive images and transmit 
them to the brain for recognition and storage.
• About 80% of information intake is through the eyes.
• The eye is our prime means of identifying what is going on around us.
• An observer’s basic understanding of the eyes’ limitations in search 
object detection is useful for an effective search.

• Vision is vulnerable to many things:
 F dust
 F fatigue
 F emotion
 F germs
 F fallen eyelashes
 F age
 F optical illusions
 F effect of alcohol
 F certain medications.
• In flight, vision is influenced by:
 F vibrations
 F atmospheric conditions

• Most importantly, the eye is vulnerable to the vagaries of the mind.
 F we can “see” and identify only what our mind permits us to see.
• One inherent problem with the eye is the time required for 
accommodation or refocusing.
 F eyes automatically accommodate for near and far objects, but to 
change from focusing on something close to something distant may

take one to two seconds.
• Another focusing problem usually occurs when there is nothing 
specifically to focus on, which happens at high altitudes but also at 
lower levels, particularly over still water and over unbroken snow.
• To actually accept what we see, we need to receive cues from both eyes.
 F if a search object is visible to only one eye, but hidden from the 
other by an obstruction, the total image is blurred and not always 
acceptable to the mind

acceptable to the mind
 F observers should move their heads when scanning around 
obstructions.
• Although eyes accept light rays from a wide arc of vision, they are limited 
to a relatively narrow field of view within which they can actually focus 
on and classify an object.
 F movement on the periphery can be perceived, but cannot be 
identified, because the mind tends not to believe what peripheral 
vision detects, which leads to “tunnel” vision

vision detects, which leads to “tunnel” vision
 F motion or contrast is needed to attract the eyes’ attention.
• The eye is also severely limited by environment.
 F optical properties of the atmosphere alter the appearance of objects, 
particularly on hazy days
 F glare, usually worse on a sunny day, makes search objects hard to 
see and scanning uncomfortable
 F an object with a high degree of contrast against the background will

be easier to see while one with low contrast at the same distance 
may be impossible to see

Appendix C
IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION) C-3
 F when the sun is behind the observer, an object may stand out 
clearly, but looking into the sun, the glare will sometimes prevent 
seeing the object.
• Since observers tend to over-estimate their visual abilities, the best 
way to perform an effective visual search is to learn efficient scanning 
techniques.
Visual scanning technique
A system should be agreed upon in advance where the observers each scan a

sector with sufficient overlap to ensure that an object is not passed undetected.
• Effective scanning is accomplished by a series of short, regularly spaced 
eye movements that bring successive areas of the ground or water into 
the central visual field.
• Each movement should not exceed 10°.
• Each area should be observed for at least two seconds (plus time to 
refocus if necessary).
• Although horizontal back-and-forth movements are preferred by most

observers, each observer should develop the scanning pattern that is 
most comfortable and then adhere to it.
• Two effective scanning patterns involve the “block” system.
 F the viewing area (windscreen) is divided into segments and the 
observer methodically scans for the search object in each block in 
sequential order
 F side-to-side scanning method
 – start at the far left of the visual area
 – make a methodical sweep to the right

– make a methodical sweep to the right
 – pause very briefly in each viewing block to focus the eyes
 – at the end of the scan, repeat
 F front-to-side scanning method
 – start in the centre block of the assigned search sector
 – move to the left
 – focus briefly in each block
 – swing quickly back to the centre after reaching the last block 
on the left
 – repeat the performance to the right
 – swing quickly back to the centre, etc.

Appendix C
C-4 IAMSAR MANUAL VOLUME III (2022 EDITION)
Note: The pilot flying a search aircraft would, at the end of the outside scan, 
scan the instrument panel, then repeat the external scan. (The pilot should 
note the need to refocus after the instrument scan.)
• Side observers in aircraft should scan from bottom to top and then top 
to bottom to avoid longer times for refocusing and allow the forward 
motion of the aircraft to move their field of vision along the track.

Note 2: If help is required from the addressee, the first SITREP should be issued in

short form if remaining information is not readily available.
Note 3: When time permits, the full form may be used for the first SITREP or to 
amplify it.
Note 4: Further SITREPs should be issued as soon as other relevant information has 
been obtained, particularly changes to on-scene weather. Information already passed 
should not need repetition.
Note 5:  During prolonged operations “no change” SITREPs, when appropriate,

should be issued at intervals of about three hours to reassure the recipients that 
nothing has been missed.
Note 6: When the incident has been concluded, a final SITREP should be issued as 
confirmation.

The OSC should ensure that reliable communications are 
maintained on scene and maintain communications with all 
SAR facilities and the RCC/SMC
• A primary and secondary frequency should be assigned for on-scene 
communications
• If there are several aircraft involved in the SAR operation and the OSC does 
not have specific aircraft coordination capability, an aircraft coordinator 
(ACO) should be appointed to maintain flight safety

• If there are relatively few units responding, communications may be kept on
